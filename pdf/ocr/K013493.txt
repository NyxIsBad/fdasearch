Device Description
The indigo® OPTIMA Laser System consists of a treatment diode laser, fiberoptic energy
delivery devices, a footswitch, and an optional cart with printer. The treatment laser allows
delivery of controlled doses of laser energy in wavelengths between 800 and 850 nanometers
(nm). When used with the OPTIMA Diffuser-Tip Fiberoptic, this laser energy is diffused
' radially at 360° to the affected tissue to provide interstitial thermotherapy (ITT), or interstitial
laser coagulation (ILC). When used with the OPTIMA Bare-Tip or cutting fiber, the laser beam
directiy contacts the tissue to provide incision, excision, ablation, or coagulation of tissues with
hemostasis. Both the OPTIMA Diffuser-Tip and Bare-Tip Fiberoptics are designed to deliver

oe
energy from the Indigo OPTIMA diode laser only and bear unique, proximal connectors to the
OPTIMA laser. The fiberoptics (fibers) are designed to be sterile, single patient use, disposable
devices. In addition, there are several accessories to the laser system including laser goggles, a
traveling case, and fiberoptic instruments for servicing and demonstration (for sales
representatives only and not for human use).
Intended Use
The Indigo OPTIMA Laser System,as a surgical instrument, is intended to be used in the noncontact mode to photocoagulate, vaporize/ablate soft tissue (muscle, connective tissue, organ),
for cutting, excision, incision, and for coagulation of soft tissue in the contact mode
(open/closed) surgical procedures. When used with bare fiberoptics, the Indigo diode laser can
be used for the excision of external tumors and lesions, complete and partial resection of
internal organs, treatment of tumors and lesions, skin incision and tissue dissection and ablation.
The Diffuser-Tip Fiberoptic is intended for the safe and effective treatment of Benign
Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH).
Comparison of Technological Characteristics
The [ndigo OPTIMA Laser System is a modification of the currently marketed indigo
LaserOptic Treatment System. While it represents a refinement to the predicate system, the
overall technology and the intended use of the two systems are the same. Both the predicate
and the modified systems are designed to treat Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) when used
with the Diffuser-Tip Fiber. and as a general surgical tool for cutting tissue when used with the
Bare-Tip Fiber. The design modifications include upgrades to the software and electronic
components, as well as modifications to the fibers to permit use with smaller cystoscopes,
having a working channel of 5 FR. New accessories to the system include a laser cart,
providing storage and mobility, and a printer to record procedure data for patient records.
The OPTIMA laser unit contains two, diode lasers that convert electrical energy to optical
energy in narrow wavelength bands. The treatment laser produces red light in the near infra-red
spectrum with a wavelength of 800-850 nm and is classified as a Class IV laser by the U.S.
Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) and according to DIN VDE 0837. The
marker laser produces light in the visible light range (approximately 633 nm) and is classified as ~
a Class II laser by CDRH. This is identical to the predicate laser system.
Performance Data
Preclinical testing was performed to ensure that the laser system performs as intended when
used according to the instructions for use. Bench testing has indicated that the system
demonstrates satisfactory performance for its intended applications. Electrical safety and
electromagnetic compatibility have been demonstrated and are certified by VDE Testing and
Certification Institute. The Indigo OPTIMA System bears the CSA International label for UL2601-1, CSA 601.1, and IEC 60601-1.
The indigo OPTIMA Laser System meets U.S. Federal Safety and Performance Standards for
light emitting products (21 CFR 1040.10/11).

Regulation Number: 878.4810

Regulation Name: Laser surgical instrument for use in general

and plastic surgery and in dermatology

Regulatory Class: II

Product Code: GEX

Dated: December 4, 2001

Received: December 5, 2001
Dear Mr. Job:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and :
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 — Mr. Mark Job
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801 and
additionally 21 CFR Part 809.10 for in vitro diagnostic devices), please contact the Office of
Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Additionally, for questions on the promotion and advertising of
