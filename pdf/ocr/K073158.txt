Date Summary Prepared: July 21, 2008

Device Trade Name: DermaSCULPT Er: YAG Laser System

Common Name: Dermatology Laser System

Classification Name: Instrument, surgical, powered, laser
79-GEX

Classification Code: 878.4810 Laser surgical instrument for use in general and plastic
surgery and in dermatology (1) A carbon dioxide laser for use in
general surgery and in dermatology is a laser device intended to
cut, destroy, or remove tissue by light energy emitted by carbon
dioxide. (2) An argon laser for use in dermatology is a laser
device intended to destroy or coagulate tissue by light energy
emitted by argon.

Predicate (Equivalent) CB Erbium 2.94 (K970934)

Device: VersaWave Dental Laser System (K041710)

Multilite Erbium: YAG Surgical Laser System (K933057)
Fidelis XS (K990243)

CuteraPearl (K070138)

Mosaic Laser System (K070392)

Erbium Fractional Handpiece (K071768)

Profile Multi-Platform System (K070388)

SmoothPeel (K unknown) Laser Peel.

Device Description: The DermaSCULPT Er:YAG Laser System [DermaSCULPT]
unit and controls are contained in a single console. Electrical
power is supplied to the console by the facility’s power source.
The laser energy produced within the device is delivered to the
tissue by means of Fiber Delivery System and specially designed

KOI 30S7
Scanner, Handpieces, Tips and Adaptors.
The user activates laser emission by means of a footswitch. The
lamp power supply causes the flash lamp to light, causing the
emission of an invisible infrared Er: YAG laser beam (2.94
microns). A visible white light pulsed beam from the flashlamp is
used as an aiming beam. The laser beam passes through a
partially reflecting mirror and then passes through the energy
monitor, after which its power is measured. When all the preconditions have been satisfied and the READY button is pressed
and the foot switch is depressed, the safety shutter opens and the
laser beam is allowed into the delivery unit coupler.
The electrical system is comprised of the laser power supply, the
control unit, calibrator, control panel, key switch, emergency stop
switch, and foot switch. The components of the laser power
supply include a high voltage power supply and a high voltage
trigger control board. The high voltage power supply uses the
high voltage to illuminate the flashlamp. The control unit
comprises a microprocessor board, accessory board and other
components that it controls. The calibrator measures the
transmittance of the fiber delivery unit. The handheld scanner
module is an attachment to the fiber.

Intended Use: The DERMASCULPT is intended for Dermatological procedures
requiring incision, excision, coagulation and vaporization of soft
tissue. The specific indications using the applicable handpieces
are as follows:

Skin resurfacing in the treatment of wrinkles and scar
revision (including acne scars) with the non-fractionated
handpiece.
Removal of cutaneous skin lesions with the micron tip
handpieces including epidermal nevi, actinic chellitis,
keloids, verrucae, skin tags, anal tags, keratosis, scar
revision, (including acne scars), benign tumors and cysts,
superficial skin lesions and diagnostic biopsies.
The DERMASCULPT with the fractionated scanner handpiece is
intended/indicated for Dermatological procedures requiring
coagulation of soft tissue and skin resurfacing.

Nonclinical Performance The review of the technical characteristics, indications for use,

Data: mechanism of action, and verification and validation information
provided demonstrate that the DermaScuipt is substantially
equivalent to its predicate device.

Clinical Performance Data: | HOYA ConBio has established that the DermaSculpt performs as
clinically intended and that no new issues of safety and
effectiveness are introduced.

Additional Information: None requested at this time.

surgery and in dermatology
Regulatory Class: I
Product Code: GEX
Dated: August 11, 2008
Received: August 25, 2008
Dear Ms. Burns:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class Ill (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance
