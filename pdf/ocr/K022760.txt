DEVICE NAME: Millennium™ Laser Photocoagulator System
Classification/Common Ophthalmic Laser Photocoagulator
name: .
Proprietary name: Millennium™ Laser Photocoagulator System
Class: 0
Panel: Ophthalmic
Product Code: HQF
The marketed device(s) to which substantial equivalence is claimed:
IRIS Medical® OcuLight® GL Laser System
Millennium™ Microsurgical System
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:
The Millennium™ Lascr Photocoagulator System is a Class 4 laser. The system is made
up of three separate components that are required to interface with each other in order to
allow laser emission. They are the Laser Module, Multifunctional Foot Contro] with laser
switch and the junction box. In order for the Millennium™ Microsurgical System to
operate the Lascr Module, the system must have laser enabled software. The software
includes functions to recognize the laser module as a network node and provides the
graphical user interface.
1

The interface performs any or all of the following functions:

® Display current laser photocoagulator operating parameters numerically.

e Display current laser photocoagulator operating status,

e Allow the surgical team to adjust laser photocoagulator operating set points and

/ modes of operation.

© Provide audio feedback confirmation.

e AJ) laser surgical interfaces shall appear readable while laser safety goggles are worn.

Two types of safety connections will be provided as part of the system:

1. a facility interlock,

2. asmart key satety filter sensing circuit.

A. Laser Module

The Laser Module contains an infrared semiconductor Continuous Wave (CW) diode
laser light as the primary source of pump energy for the yttrium vanadate laser which is
then wavelength converted to a visible green laser light for delivery to the patient’s eye.
A second visible red semiconductor CW laser is used for aiming. The treatment and
pilot/aiming beams are optically combined inside the laser head and therefore, follow the
same path.

The outer module housing consists of a front cover, chassis and chassis cover. The front ,
cover provides mounting locations and access to the Laser Aperture, Laser Indirect
Ophthalmoscope Mlumination Connection, Key Switch, and Emergency Laser Stop
Button.

The laser aperture is the distal end of the delivery device connected to the Laser Port on
the module. The Laser Port is interlocked so that no laser energy can be emitted without
the correct connection to a recognized delivery device. Since cach type of delivery
device has different losses due to varying optical components, the delivery device
communicates electronically to the control system in the laser module. A transmission
factor stored in the module’s permanent memory calculates the power delivered out the
delivery device and displays this calibrated value on the touch screen. This ensures
accurate laser emission thus eliminating the need for user adjustment during calibration.
B. Multifunction Foot Controller with Laser Integrated Foot Switch
The Multifunctional Foot Controller connects to the Millennium™ Microsurgical System
by an integral cord. The Multifunctional Foot Controller is watertight and corrosion
resistant. The Multifunctional Foot Controller provides controls for the various modules
and peripherals. It is comprised of a center foot pedal and five switches.

2

Center Pedal
The center pedal provides linear controls via pitch and yaw movements of the
pedal. Each of the controls is fully programmable with respect to function and
control parameter.
Switches
The Multifunctional Foot Controller has up to five buttons or switches. One of
which is a dedicated laser switch. The four function switches are programmable
. tO provide controls for all applicable Milennium™ Microsurgical System
functions.
Laser Switch
The laser switch, when actuated, sends a laser-firing signal to the Laser Module.
The laser switch is located at the base of the foot pedal. When the laser is to be
fired, the cover is manually open. However, when the cover is open the switch
still remains shrouded.
C. Laser Junction Box
The laser junction box is designed such that laser emission can not occur without it. The
junction box connects to the foot switch via cabling, the cabling in combination with the
box are the conduits through which the laser switch sends the laser firing signal to the
Laser Module.
D. Laser Foot Switch
The Laser Foot Switch is dedicated only to firing the laser, it does not contain any other
functional switches. It contains a safety shroud to protect against accidental activation,
watertight switches and a dual redundant electrical safety system.
STATEMENT OF INDICATIONS FOR USE
The Jaser modes ate intended for retinal photocoagulation and Jaser trabeculaplasty.
Delivery devices available are the Endoprobe for intraocular endolaser surgery, and the
Laser Indirect Ophthalmoscope Plus (LIO+) for transpupillary laser delivery for patients
in the supine position. :

SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE —
The following is a comparison of the Millennitum™ Laser Photocoagulator System to the
IRIS Medical® OcuLight® GL Laser System.
The Millenntum™ Laser Photocoagulator System is substantially equivalent to the IRIS
Medical® OcuLight® GL Laser System produced by the [RIDEX Corporation in that
both are semiconductor based continuous wave green light lasers to be used for retinal
photocoagulation.

Similarities .

e Both the Millennium™ Laser Photocoagulator System and the OcuLight® GL
Laser System are intended for retinal photocoagulation procedures.

¢ Both the Millennium™ Laser Photocoagulator System and the OcuLight® GL
Laser System contain an infrared (808 nm) semiconductor continuous wave diode
as its primary source of optical energy.

e Both the Millennium™ Laser Photocoagulator System and the OcuLight® GL
Laser System use treatment laser beams that are generated in the identical optical
cascade. /

e Both the Millennium™ Laser Photocoagulator System and the OcuLight® GL
Laser System use the identical EndoProbe® and Laser Indirect Ophthalmoscope
Plus as laser delivery devices.

Differences ‘

« The Millennium™ Laser Photocoagulator System is a modular system.

¢ The OcuLight® GL Laser System is a complete integrated laser system.

Dear Mr. Pozzo:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
