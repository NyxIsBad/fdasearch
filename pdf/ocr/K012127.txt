The PulseMaster Erbium Dental Laser System is a solid state Er:YAG laser
consisting of three internally connected subassemblies: the power supply, the water
cooling system, and the Er:YAG pump cavity and resonator assembly. Delivery is
via a fiber optic with a sapphire contact tip. The laser delivers up to 400 mJ per
pulse, with pulse repetition rates ranging from 10 to 60 Hz and an average power of
up to 7.5 Watts.
6. BASIS FOR SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE
The PulseMaster Erbium Dental Laser System has the same intended use and the
same or substantially equivalent technica! specifications and mechanism of action as
compared with the named predicate devices. All of the devices are indicated for both
hard and soft tissue applications in dental procedures and oral maxillofacial surgery.
All of the devices utilize an Er: YAG solid state laser source operating at a
wavelength of 2.94 microns, fiber delivery systems with contact tips, and operating
parameters within the same ranges as the PulseMaster Erbium Dental Laser System.

Dear Ms. Hemeon-Heyer:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device

You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may

CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
