Description:
Intended Use:
The OmniGuide Sterile WaveGuide Adapter System is indicated for the incision,
excision, ablation, vaporization and coagulation of body soft tissues including intra-oral
tissues. It is indicated in the medical specialties of general and plastic surgery,
oral/maxillofacial surgery, dentistry, dermatology, gynecology, otorhinolaryngology,
gastroenterology, neurosurgery, urology, and pulmonology, and can be used in open
surgical procedures as well as endoscopic minimally invasive procedures in conjunction
with rigid or flexible endoscopes, such as in laryngoscopy, gastroscopy, colonoscopy,
laparoscopy, thoracoscopy, hysteroscopy and bronchoscopy.
The indications for use for which the delivery system is used for are dependent upon the
cleared indications for use of the laser system and those laser system accessories to which
it is attached.
Summary of Technological Characteristics:
The OmniGuide Sterile WaveGuide Adapter System connects a hospitals CO, laser to the
OmniGuide WaveGuide Fibers. The additional filter and autoclave sterilization of the
adapter and hose allows for use in sterile surgical procedures.
The output tube and gas hose will be sold non-sterile and the hospital will autoclave
sterilize. The filter element may be provided as a gamma sterilized device (high Pressure
option) or as a non sterile device for autoclave sterilization. The low pressure filter may
be autoclave sterilized or provided sterile at the end users request. See section S for
sterilization validation activites.
Performance Data:
Non-clinical Performance Data:
The OmniGuide Sterile WaveGuide Adapter System performance characteristics have
been evaluated through testing and analysis of laser power output and beam quality. This
type of testing complies with the respective section of the FDA Guidance on the Content
and Organization of a Premarket Notification for a Medical Laser (1995) and is similar to
the predicate device tests. The performance of the OmniGuide Sterile WaveGuide
Adapter System and the related parameters of the predicate device is comparable.
Clinical Performance Data:
Formal clinical trials were not deemed necessary as the device is using the same
technology and intended use as the predicate device.

Conclusions Drawn from Tests and Analysis:
The intended use and major performance parameters (energy transmission levels and
beam quality) of the OmniGuide Sterile WaveGuide Adapter System are similar or
equivalent to the characteristics of above mentioned legally marketed devices.

Dated: December 3, 2007

Received: December 4, 2007
Dear Mr. Job:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 51 O(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, “Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance
at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address
