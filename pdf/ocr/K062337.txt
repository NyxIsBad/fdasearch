DEVICE DESCRIPTION:
Predicate Devices:
Aesculap USA: Modular Monopolar Electrodes K970541
ACMI Circon: Surgical Instrument for Minimally Invasive Surgery K914883
INTENDED USE:
Laparoscopic Electrodes and Handle are used to grasp, hold, coagulate, and cut tissue during
laparoscopic surgical procedures
DEVICE COMPONENTS AND OPERATION:
Laparoscopic electrodes and handles are surgical instruments with interchangeable tip inserts
designed to be introduced through a 5.5mm diameter (or larger) cannula, during laparoscopic
surgical procedures. The devices can be used with electrosurgical generators. The interchange
ability of the tip inserts allows for three main benefits:
e A removable insert allows for easier cleaning and disinfection of the instrument

components,
e Versatility of the instrument is greatly increased as one handle can accept many tip

configurations,
e Semi-disposability allows for multiple uses of one tip insert with cost effective

replacement when worn or damaged.
The device consists of two components: an insulated, reusable handle and a series of reusable
tips. Radiofrequency energy is passed to the tip through the handle and shaft by using a powered
lead from an electrosurgical generator to a connector port on the handle. The insulated handle is
the device that will be used by the physician or nurse to attach the tip and control the action of the
tip via the grip. A rotary knob allows the tip to be positioned (rotated) while in the cannula.

, 510(k) SUMMARY (per CFR21 807.92(c))
ft “ge 2 4d)

These devices use technology substantially equivalent to the Aesculap USA Modular Monopolar
Electrodes (K970541) and the ACMI Circon Surgical Instrument for Minimally Invasive Surgery
(K914883). Each consists of handles and a series of electrodes that are used to cut and coagulate
tissue through the utilization of high frequency radiofrequency energy.
Laparoscopic electrodes are reusable and are resterilized using steam sterilization.
Aaron Laparoscopic Electrodes and Handle conform to the requirements of safety standard
ANSI/AAMI HF-18 Electrosurgical Devices.
There are no significant differences in technology, performance, or intended use between the
Aaron Laparoscopic Electrodes and Handle and the given predicate devices. There are no new
questions raised regarding safety or effectiveness.

Dear Mr. Kozloff:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for
use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce
prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good
manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
. be found in the Code of Federal! Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may

or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply
with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part
807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the
quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820): and if applicable, the electronic product
radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act): 21 CFR 1000-1050

; Page 2 — Mr. Richard A. Kozloff
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
