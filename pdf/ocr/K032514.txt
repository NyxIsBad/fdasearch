510(k) SUMMARY OF SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS
SYNERON MEDICAL Ltd. AC applicator

This summary of safety and effectiveness information is being submitted in

accordance with the requirements of the SMDA 1990 and 21 CFR 807.92.

Submitter: Syneron Medical Ltd., Sultam Industrial park, P.O.B. 550,
Yokneam Elite 20692, Israel.
Tel. +972-4-909-7424 ext. 7604, Fax +972-4-909-7417

Name of the Device: AC applicator

Predicate Devices: AC applicator is substantially equivalent to a combination of
the following devices: Aurora SR, manufactured by Syneron
Medical Ltd. and subject of K031993. ClearLight phototherapy
device, manufactured by CureLight and subject of K013623.
Omnilux Blue, manufactured by Photo Therapeutics limited
and subject of K030883. Smoothbeam laser system,
manufactured by Candela Corp. and subject of K014128.

Device Description: The AC applicator is a device that is used for the treatment of
moderate inflammatory acne vulgaries. The AC applicator
treatment is based on the principle of selective
(electromagnetic) thermolysis combined with photochemical
reaction of the acne bacteria. According to this principle,
parameters of optical and RF energy (spectrum, exposure
duration and energy density) are chosen and optimized to
selectively damage acne bacteria and the sebaceous glands
without damaging the surrounding tissues.

The AC applicator is intended for the treatment of moderate inflammatory acne

vulgaries.

Based upon an analysis of the overall performance characteristic for the device,

Syncron Medical Ltd. believes that no significant differences exit. Therefore the AC

applicator should raise no new issues of safety or effectiveness.

Dear: Dr. Waldman:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the gencral controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CER Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 51 0(k)

marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
