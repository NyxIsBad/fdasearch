4. DESCRIPTION OF THE DEVICES
The VECTEC Disposable Trocars and Laparoscopic Accessories can be used in a variety
of procedures (general, vascular, gynecological and thoracic surgical procedures) to cut,
dissect, manipulate, and/or cauterize various tissues. Trocars are sterile, single-use
devices that allow visualization of body cavities and use of the laparoscopic accessories.
The accessory devices are disposable, single use, individually packaged devices that are
composed of biocompatible materials. Scissors, forceps, and dissectors have a handle
attached to an insulated shaft with different tips, which allows the shaft and tip to rotate.
They include a male cautery connector when attached to standard monopolar cautery
cables and their generators. All devices are sterilized using a traditional, validated
ethylene oxide procedure per EN 550:1994 to a SAL of 10° and with acceptable residual
EO levels per ISO 0993-7:1995.
5. INDICATIONS FOR USE AND INTENDED USE
The VECTEC Disposable Trocar and Laparoscopic Accessories are single-use, sterile
devices intended to provide access to and visualization of body cavities, organs, and
canals and to cut, dissect, manipulate, and/or cauterize various tissues during
endoscopic/laparoscopic, general, vascular, gynecological and thoracic surgical
procedures. Accessories include scissors, forceps, dissectors and a hook.
6. SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE
The VECTEC Trocars (the subject of this application) and the predicate trocars
(K994066) are both manufactured by VECTEC and are identical; thus, they are
substantially equivalent.
Substantial equivalence of the scissors, forceps, dissectors, and hook is demonstrated by
the similarity in Intended Use of instruments to their predicate. The devices are similar in
characteristics to the predicate devices, and both are composed of biocompatible
materials. The energy source that is used with the VECTEC accessories, monopolar
electrosurgical energy, is the same as used for the predicate devices. Comparison of

SUMMARY OF SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS (Continued)
technological characteristics and bench electrosurgical device performance testing has
confirmed that the VECTEC Disposable Trocars and Laparoscopic Accessories are
substantially equivalent to the predicate devices.
7. PERFORMANCE TESTING
VECTEC laparoscopic accessories met the dielectric withstand testing requirements of
ANSI/AAMI HF-18:2001.
8. CONCLUSIONS
Based on the technical testing and dimensional information and intended use information
provided, the VECTEC Disposable Trocars and Laparoscopic Accessories have been
shown to be substantially equivalent to the predicate devices listed above.

Dear Dr. Horwitz:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801 ), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
“Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
(240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address http://www. fda.gov/cdrh/industry/support/index.html.
