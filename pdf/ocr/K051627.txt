Contact: Herbert Vinson
Telephone: 303-530-6469
Date summary prepared: June 17, 2005
2. Name of Device
Trade or Proprietary Name: Valleylab G3000 Electrosurgical Device
Common Name: Monopolar electrosurgical device
Classification Name: Class II, 21 CFR 878.4400, Electrosurgical Cutting and
Coagulation Device and Accessories, Panel 79, General and Plastic Surgery
3. Predicate Devices
The G3000 Electrosurgical Device is substantially equivalent in function and
intended use to the Valleylab E2516 Electrosurgical Pencil (K813071) and the
Valleylab E2517 Power Control Pencil (K861112). All three devices are used for
monopolar electrosurgery, allowing the surgeon to actuate the electrosurgical
generator from the sterile field using push button controls on the device. All devices
are used with conventional electrosurgical electrodes with a 2.4mm (3/32 inch) shaft
diameter, such as coated and uncoated blade, needle, ball, LLETZ loop, and
arthroscopy electrodes.
4. Device Description
The G3000 Electrosurgical Device is a handheld, single-use device designed to
deliver monopolar RF electrosurgical energy to a surgical site to cut and/or
coagulate tissue. The G3000 Electrosurgical Device is designed for use only with
the Valleylab ForceTriad™ Electrosurgical Generator (510(k) application submitted),
and has a connector that will only fit into the ForceTriad™ generator. The G3000
connector is a “smart connector” that allows the ForceTriad™ generator to verify the
device type. The device body incorporates “soft touch” material to improve the
surgeon’s grip.

The surgeon activates the desired electrosurgical mode from the sterile field by
using one of three push buttons on the device. Three electrosurgical modes are
available:
e Cut —cuts tissue with minimal coagulation / hemostasis
e Hemostasis with Division — divides tissue with controlled hemostasis
e Coag —coagulates bleeding vessels to provide hemostasis
The surgeon can also control the power settings of the electrosurgical generator
from the sterile field using a slider control on the device.
The G3000 Electrosurgical Device uses conventional electrosurgical electrodes,
such as coated and uncoated blade, needle, ball, LLETZ loops, and arthroscopy
electrodes, with a 2.4mm (3/32 inch) shaft diameter. Valley!ab initially intends to
market the G3000 Electrosurgical Device with Valleylab coated blade electrodes
(K955836, K962044), 10 and 15 foot cord lengths, and Valleylab disposable safety
holsters (K791639). Alternate configurations with other electrodes are anticipated in
the future.
5. Intended Use
The G3000 Electrosurgical Device is a single-use device intended for use in surgical
procedures (such as general, urologic, thoracic, plastic and reconstructive,
gynecologic, arthroscopic) where the surgeon desires monopolar radio-frequency
electrosurgical energy to cut and/or coagulate tissue. The G3000 Electrosurgical
Device is intended for use with the Valleylab ForceTriad™ Electrosurgical Generator
and conventional monopolar electrosurgical electrodes, such as coated and
uncoated blade, needle, ball, LLETZ loop, and arthroscopic electrodes.
There are no specific contraindications associated with the G3000 Electrosurgical
Device. General contraindications and warnings related to the use of electrosurgery,
as outlined in the user instructions for Valleylab electrosurgical generators, apply to
the G3000 Electrosurgical Device.
6. Summary of Technological Characteristics
The G3000 Electrosurgical Device has the same basic technological characteristics
as the predicate devices noted above.
7. Performance Data
Performance testing was performed to ensure that the G3000 Electrosurgical Device
functions as intended, and meets design specifications. Sufficient data were
obtained to show that the device is substantially equivalent to the predicate devices,
and meets safety and effectiveness criteria.

Dear Mr. Vinson:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CER Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation contro! provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 — Mr. Herbert Vinson

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market. ae oo.
