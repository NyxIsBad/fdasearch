510(k) Summary Statement for the
Lumenis Novus Spectra Laser System

General Information:
Submitter: Lumenis

2400 Condensa Street

Santa Clara, California, U.S. A.

95051-0901
Contact Person: Karen Baker
Summary Preparation Date: October 10, 2002
Names:
Device Names: Novus Spectra Laser System
Primary Classification Name: 79 GEX, Laser instrument, Surgical Powered
Predicate Devices:
Elite Solid State Green Diode Pumped 532nm
Elite Ultra Solid State Green Diode Pumped 532nm
Corium 200 Solid State Green Diode Pumped 532nm
Corium 400 Solid State Green Diode Pumped 532nm
Rationale for Substantial Equivalence:
The Novus Spectra Laser System has the same indications for use as the Elite
family of lasers and the Corium series of lasers, They have similar functional
elements such as treatment wavelengths, pulse rates, treatment power, spot size
and cooling system. Control systems such as the door interlock, and the safety
systems and displays are constantly monitored in these systems for user
intervention during a procedure or maintenance.
Description of Submitted Device:
The Novus Spectra solid state, frequency-doubled, green Nd:YAG surgical laser
system is an instrument used in the photothermolysis (photocoagulation) of soft
tissue at en emission wavelength of 532nm.
Compatible delivery devices include: slit lamps, slit lamp adapters/attachments,
laser indirect ophthalmoscopes (LIO), microfilters, collimated handpieces with spot
sizes ranging from 200-1200microns, fibers and endocular and endooto probes.

Indications for Use:
Ophthaimic Applications; Ear, Nose and Throat Applications; Dentistry; and
Dermatologic Applications. A complete list is contained in the Indications for Use
Statement.
Technological Characteristics and Substantial Equivalence
The Novus Spectra Laser System, the Elite family of lasers, and the Corium series
deliver the same frequency-doubled Nd:YAG wavelength. Both deliver a 532nm
wavelength of similar power and pulses having simitar duration in single and
repeat modes.
The Novus Spectra Laser System is identical to the Elite family of lasers, and the
Corium series in terms of its intended uses and functionality. The Novus Spectra
improves on the industry-standard digital operating environment present in the
Elite to manage energy output, pulse duration and other functional aspects. A
digital “closed loop” control system in the Novus Spectra replaces the analog
“closed loop” contro! system in the Elite and Corium. In addition the digital
environment improves the overall safety of the system through improved and more
rigorously controlled hazard mitigation hardware
Conclusion
The Novus Spectra Laser System is substantially equivalent to the Elite and
Corium laser systems that are now in commercial distribution and have been
successful in meeting the intended uses. The Novus Spectra has an improved
hazard mitigation and risk management operating environment that reduces the
level of concern regarding its uses per the Intended Uses document.
The Lumenis Novus Spectra shares the sarne intended use, indications for use,
and similar technological! characteristics as the predicate laser systems.

Dear Ms. Baker:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class I] (Special Controls) or class IH (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as
setforth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the
electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 10001050.

This Jetter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) .
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to
proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801 and
additionally 21 CFR Part 809.10 for in vitro diagnostic devices), please contact the Office of
Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Additionally, for questions on the promotion and advertising of
your device, please contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4639. Also, please note the
regulation entitled, “Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21 CFR Part 807.97).
