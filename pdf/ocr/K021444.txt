have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic

therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good
manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
