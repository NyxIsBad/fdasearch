Performance Data: No performance data is required for this Class Il
device nor requested by the Food and Drug
Administration (Office of Device Evaluation). The
BLU-U has the same spectral output, mode of
operation, treatment area, and general operating
principals as well as the same_ intended use, the
same general and specific indications for use as
the predicate device. A data base search has
been performed to evaluate any adverse effects of

Substantial Equivalence: The Model 4170 BLU-U® Photodynamic Therapy
Illuminator is substantially equivalent to the
previously cleared ClearLight™ Phototherapy
Device, Model CL 420. The BLU-U has the same
intended use and has the same general and
specific indications for use as the Clearlight™.
The spectral output, mode of operation, treatment
area, and general operating principals for the
BLU-U® are similar to or the same as the
Clearlight™. The BLU-U® and the ClearLight™
are both light devices that are used to treat
dermatological conditions by exposing the surface
of the skin to light at precise wavelengths.
Although there are some differences in method by
which each device produces light, these
differences do not raise new question of safety or
efficacy. Thus, the BLU-U® is substantially
equivalent.

Dear Mr. Lundahl:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device

commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of

adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class Il (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may

CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
