Appeal of Not Substantially Equivalent Decision

Dated: December 18, 2008

Received: December 19, 2008
Dear Dr. Ladin:
‘This letter is in response to your letter of appeal dated December 18, 2008, requesting
that the not substantially equivalent (NSE) decision for the above reference premarket
notification submission (510(k)) that was issued on December 3, 2008, from Mark N.
Melkerson, Director, Division of General, Restorative. and Neurological Devices
(DGRND), now the Division of Surgical, Orthopedic, and Restorative Devices
(DSORD), Office of Device Evaluation, be reviewed by the next level supervisor. I have
reviewed this appeal under our regulations found in Title 21 of the Code of Federal
Regulations Part 10.75 Internal agency review of decision, as the next level supervisor.
After reviewing your letter of appeal, including my review of the 510(k), meeting
internally on several occasions with DSORD, and discussing your appeal with you and
your clients on February 17, 2009, and consulting with my clinical deputy, | have
determined that your device has performance that is substantially equivalent to predicate
devices cleared for over-the-counter used in the treatment of mild to moderate acne. My
decision is based on the fact that your 510(k) contained data from a randomized, shamcontrolled, double-blinded, clinical trial demonstrating that your device provides a
statistically and clinically significant improvement in the time to improvement and time
to resolution of mild to moderate acne when compared to sham treatment, as assessed by
blinded investigators. | have determined that these data are sufficient to provide a
reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of your device for the purposes of
demonstrating substantial equivalence. Therefore, | am overturning the NSE decision
from DSORD and issuing a letter of substantial equivalence (enclosed) for the above
referenced device as described in the 510(k).

found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); medical device reporting (reporting of medical
