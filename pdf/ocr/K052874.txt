devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.

/ If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it

CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
