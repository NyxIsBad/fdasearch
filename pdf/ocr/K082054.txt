Intended Uses —_ ee age a
The Gyrus ACMI PK (PlasmaKinctic) SuperPulse System is intended for use for the
ablation, removal, resection, and coagulation of soft tissue, and where associated
hemostasis is required in open, endoscopic, and laparoscopic surgical procedures.
These devices are marketed as reusable devices; methods for cleaning, disinfecting
and sterilization are included in latter sections of this submission under Section 12.0,
“Cleaning”.
Product Description
The currently marketed Gyrus ACMI PK SuperPulse System is a bipolar RF
generator that accepts a variety of disposable hand pieces that utilize a PlasmaKinetic
(PK) waveform. The generator face includes two sockets that allow a range of hand
pieces to be utilized in a dry field environment, although only one socket may be
active at any given time.
The Gyrus ACMI PK SuperPulse System General Purpose Electrosurgical Generator
employs a system of automatic instrument detection, through a capacitor located in
the hand piece connector plug. This ensures that only the allowable range of
waveform output and power level can only be applied to the instrument irrespective
of the output socket. Accessories presently provided with the Gyrus ACMI PK
SuperPulse System include a power cable and a foot switch. It should be noted that /
this footswitch is also used with the Gyrus ACMI General Surgery Workstation
generator (cleared under K050550).
This Special 510(k) proposes the addition of a new optional accessory, the Dual
Footswitch Connector Cable. The Dual Footswitch Connector Cable allows for easier
use of the Gyrus ACMI PK SuperPulse System when multiple surgeons are present.
This is achieved by allowing the connection and use of two footswitches on the same
generator. The indications for use, principles of operation, energy waveform outputs,
and accessories of the Gyrus ACMI PK SuperPulse System with the Dual Footswitch
Connector Cable accessory remain the same as the currently marketed Gyrus ACMI
PK SuperPulse System.
Summary of Safety and Effectiveness
The proposed modifications for the Gyrus ACMI PK SuperPulse System, as
described in this submission, are substantially equivalent to the predicate device. The
proposed addition of the Dual Footswitch Connector Cable as an accessory is not a
substantial change or modification, and do not significantly affect the safety or
efficacy of the devices.
