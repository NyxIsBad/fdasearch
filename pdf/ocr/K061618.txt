Dear Mr. Johnson:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device

devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,

You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
