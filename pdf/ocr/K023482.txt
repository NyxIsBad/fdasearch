SUMMARY OF SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS
FOR THE JAN 15 2003
MODEL 26-2500, AURA 20, BIPOLAR ELECTROSURGICAL
COAGULATOR
K 023462
The Model 26-2500, Aura 20, Bipolar Electrosurgical Coagulator, is a general purpose solid state
bipolar generator used to supply the RF signal to electrosurgical handpieces used on soft body
tissues where a wide range of tissue types, patient conditions, and load impedances are encountered.
This indication for use is identical to its predicate device 1.e., the 28-/000, Kirwan 50 Watt Bipolar
Generator.
Technological safety and effectiveness is established by the fact that the Aura 20, like its predicates,
offers well-proven, basic electrosurgical unit technology. Its footswitch activation and solid state
circuitry delivers low voltage RF/bipolar energy, interfacing with electrosurgical accessories via its
standard female banana jacks. The Aura 20 differs technologically from its predicates with only
minor operational features designed to enhance user interface. The following are some of those
features.
= While operating on both 115 and 230 VAC mains supply as its predicates, the Aura 20
does not require the placement of an external jumper in order to select between the two :
different voltage levels.
= Activation of the Aura 20 is via footswitch only, eliminating the optional hand switch
activation of its predicates, which is viewed as a little-used option and expendable in order
to simplify construction, and limit size.
= While similarly relying on solid-state electronics, the Aura 20 has been greatly simplified
over its predicates by the use of microprocessor technology and modular medical-grade
power supply.
= The Aura 20 uses membrane keypads instead of potentiometers (knobs) as adjustable
controls for tonal volume and power level settings.
Performance safety has been tested in accordance with, and found to comply with, the requirements
of the applicable sections of the following standards;
= ANSI/AAMI/IEC 60601-1-2 (2001), Medical Electrical Equipment Part 1; General
Requirements for the Safety.
= TEC 60601-2-2 (1998), Medical Electrical Equipment Part 2; particular Requirements for
the safety of High Frequency Surgical Equipment.
=  ANSI/AAMI HF 18 (2001), American National Standard for Electrosurgical Devices
Therefore, the Aura 20 is substantially equivalent in intended use, technological safety and
effectiveness, and performance to both the;
= 26-1500, Kirwan 20 Watt Bipolar Micro Coagulator, and
= 28-1000, Kirwan 50 Watt Bipolar Generator.

Trade/Device Name: Aura 20 Bipolar Electrosurgical Coagulator, Model 26-2500
Regulation Number: 878.4400
Regulation Name: Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation device and accessories
Regulatory Class: Class II
Product Code: GEI
Dated: October 16, 2002
Received: October 17, 2002
Dear Mr. Prario:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for
use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce
prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good
manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

i Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply
with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR
Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in

Page 2 — Mr. Kevin P. Prario
the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product
radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). Other general
information on your responsibilities under the Act may be obtained from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
(301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address
