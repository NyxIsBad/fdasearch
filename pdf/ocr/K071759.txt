Intended Use / Indications for Use
The LTC VAD.400 is an electrosurgical generator coupled with designated
LTC electrosurgical instruments for bipolar tissue fusion. The LTC VAD.400
electrosurgical generator and designated LTC electrosurgical instruments
(i.e., “the VAD System”) are intended for use in open general surgical
procedures where ligation of vessels and ducts is desired and as an
alternative to mechanical clamping (clips or staples) or suturing. The LTC
VAD System can be used on vessels up to 7mm in diameter, on ducts up to
2mm in diameter, and tissue bundles as large as will fit in the jaw electrodes
of the instrument.
The LTC VAD system has not yet been tested for use in tubal sterilization or
tubal coagulation for sterilization procedures; therefore, the company does
not recommend the use of the LTC VAD system for such procedures. In
addition, LTC recommends against the use of the VAD System for male
circumcisions.

Technological Characteristics
The LTC VAD System consists of: a bipolar electrosurgical generator and
two distinct and dedicated electrosurgical instruments.

Performance Data ,
Bench, animal and clinical testing was conducted using the LTC VAD
System. In all instances, the LTC VAD System functioned as intended and
all results observed were as expected.

Substantial Equivalence

The LTC VAD System is as safe and effective as the predicate devices. The
LTC VAD System has the same intended uses and similar indications,
technological characteristics, and principles of operation as its predicate
device. The minor technological differences between the LTC VAD System
and its predicate devices raise no new issues of safety or effectiveness. Thus,
the LTC VAD System is substantially equivalent.

Dear Mr. Holstein:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean.
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

‘This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarkct notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labcling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Posimarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464, You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
