Date of Summary: [DATE]
Product Code: GEX, OCL
Classification Name: Laser Instrument, Surgical Powered
Common Name: Surgical Laser Instrument
Proprietary Name ATRILAZE™ Surgical Ablation System
Description of Device:
The ATRILAZE™ Surgical Ablation System consists of a Laser Energy Generator,
system cart, fluid delivery pump, fluid delivery tubing set and a fixed or flexible surgical
ablation wand of various lengths. The wand is an intraoperative, sterile, single-use
device designed to apply laser energy to cardiac tissue. The fluid delivery tubing set is a
single-use device having a sterile fluid path designed for the delivery of sterile saline
solution to the wand tip. The fluid delivery tubing may be provided together with the
wand or as an accessory device. The fluid delivery pump and laser energy generator are
sold separately. The wand includes a ridged metallic shaft or a flexible shaft of various
lengths, and is equipped with a 905 SMA connector cable which attaches to the laser
energy generator output connector. The emitted laser energy is directed toward the target
tissue from the end of the optical fiber which rides within the flexible track.
Statement of Intended Use:
The ATRILAZE™ Surgical Ablation System is indicated for delivery of 810nm, 1064nm
or 1083nm laser light to soft tissue to include cardiac tissue during surgical procedures.
Indications include the incision, excision, dissection, vaporization, ablation, or
coagulation of soft tissue.

The ATRILAZE™ Surgical Ablation System Accessories are intended for use in the
support of the delivery of laser light to soft tissue to include cardiac tissue during surgical
procedures.
Warning:

The ATRILAZE™ Surgical Ablation System is not indicated for the treatment of
cardiac arrhythmias.

The risk of actual damage to adjacent organs from the instrument exists and
perforation, rupture or tearing of tissue, may occur as a complication of laser use. Burns
can occur if the laser energy is not correctly applied. These complications may be serious.
Technological Comparison:

The ATRILAZE™ Surgical Ablation System was compared to the current
ATRILAZE™ Surgical Ablation System (K060680).

Both the currently available device and the ATRILAZE™ wand as reviewed in
this 510(k) are provided sterile with a sterile fluid path for saline delivery at the laser tip.
Both fiber optic delivery systems utilize the same laser energy generator and are
connected via an SMA 905 connector to deliver laser energy to the target tissue.

For purposes of this submission, the ATRILAZE™ Surgical Ablation System was ,
compared to the following predicate devices: ATRILAZE™ Surgical Ablation System
(K060680).

Testing:

Testing demonstrated that adherence to specifications was demonstrated and the
lesions obtained using the ATRILAZE™ wand with 1083nm laser light are substantially
equivalent to those obtained with the currently cleared ATRILAZE™ Surgical Ablation
System wavelengths.

Dear Mr. Honour:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 - Mr. Kirk S. Honour
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, “Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
