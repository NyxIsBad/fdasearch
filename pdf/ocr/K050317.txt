2. Names
Device Name: BURANE XL
Classification Name: Laser Instrument, Surgical Powered
Product Code: GEX
Panel: Dermatology and Plastic Surgery
3. Predicate Devices
The BURANE XL laser system is substantially equivalent to the AesculapMeditec MCL 29 Dermablate Laser System (K992707 and K964128), the
Dornier Medilas E Laser (K981438), the Cynosure CO3 Er:YAG Laser
(K983034), the Laserscope Laser VELA (K971843) and the Sciton Er:'YAG
Laser PROFILE 3000 (K040005).
4. Device Description
BURANE XL is a Er:YAG laser system for dermatological interventions and
for aesthetic laser applications. The triple mode technology makes BURANE
XL an expert device: the special controllable Coaguattion Mode for different
coagulation depths, the Ablation Mode for classical ablation procedures, and
the combination of both techniques.

510(k) Summary of Safety and Effectiveness
a
Furthermore, the laser system enables a quick, precise ablation with minimal
thermal tissue damage. Thus an optimal wound healing process is achieved
— the risk of scar formation is minimized. This is due to the BURANE XL’s
wavelength of 2.94 ym, which has an absorption maximum in water and is
therefore absorbed very well by tissue water. The thermal! damage zone is
thus minimized.
While the parameters wavelength and pulse form are specified by the device,
spot size, laser energy, pulse sequence, and coagulation function can be
selected by the treating physician for optimal adjustment to individual
requirements.
5. Indications for Use
The BURANE XL is indicated:
The BURANE XL is intended to be used in small and large joint arthroscopy,
laparoscopic procedures, general and all surgical procedures for
incision/excision, vaporization, ablation, and coagulation of soft tissue and
cartilage. All soft tissues encountered in all surgical procedures are included
in this indication such as, skin, cutaneous tissue, subcutaneous tissue,
straited and smooth tissue, muscle, cartilage, meniscus, mucous membrane,
lymph vessels and nodes, organs and glands. The BURANE XL is indicated
for use in skin resurfacing. The BURANE XL is indicated for use in medicine
and surgery, in the following medical specialities: Dermatology, Plastic

Dear Mr. Sammons:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class Ll (Special Controls) or class HI (PMA), tt
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean

or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
