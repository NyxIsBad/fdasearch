IV. Product Description
The Novus Varia Laser System is an air cooled, diode-pumped, solid state, Nd:YAG, threecolor laser system (green, yellow and red) intended for use in the treatment of ocular
pathology. A red diode laser provides a visible aiming beam. The Novus Varia system is
comprised of the following functional components: a laser console; control and display
panel; system microprocessor control electronics; two fiber ports for delivery systems; eye
safety filter port; a covered footswitch; operating software; an optional remote control unit;
an optional printer; delivery devices with accessories
Compatible delivery devices include: the LaserLink Z and LaserLink Z-1000 Slit Lamp
Delivery Adapters; the Laser Indirect Ophthalmoscope (Heine and Keeler models) and the

V. Indications for Use

The Novus Varia Ophthalmic Laser and Delivery Devices is intended for use in the

treatment of ocular pathology. The NovusVaria is indicated for use in photocoagulation of

both anterior and posterior segments including:

e Retinal photocoagulation, panretinal photocoagulation and intravitreal
endophotocoagulation of vascular and structural abnormalities of the retina and
choroid including:

- proliferative and nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy;
- choroidal neovascularization;

- branch retinal vein occlusion;

- age-related macular degeneration

- retinal tears and detachments

- retinopathy of prematurity

e Iridotomy, iridectomy and trabeculoplasty in angle closure glaucoma and open angle
glaucoma

Laser Indirect Ophthalmoscope

The Laser Indirect Ophthalmoscope is indicated for use in the following ophthalmic

treatments: diabetic retinopathy (panretinal photocoagulation); retinopexy; segmental

peripheral photocoagulation; segmental photocoagulation; cloudy vitreous cavities; and,
pediatric retinal repairs (under general anesthesia)

Endophotocoagulation

The Acculite Endoprobe is indicated for use in the following ophthalmic applications:

photocoagulation of the anterior and posterior segment, including: anterior segment

treatment in the surgical management of glaucoma; endophotocoagulation in vitreoretinal
surgery, including panretinal photocoagulation, retinopexy, and treatment of
neovascularization.

VI. Rationale for Substantial Equivalence

The Novus Varia Ophthalmic Laser with Delivery Devices and Accessories share the same

intended use, indications for use and the same or similar technological characteristics

(including treatment wavelengths, laser active medium, pumping system, aiming beam,

mode of operation, exposure duration, power, treatment intervals, spot sizes, controls and

displays, laser energy delivery control (footswitch), and delivery systems), and therefore is

substantially equivalent to the predicate devices referenced in Section III.

VII. Performance Data

System and software hazard analysis information and software verification and validation

information was submitted in conjunction with this Premarket Notification submission.

The determination of substantial equivalence was based upon the comparison of the

technical characteristics between the Novus Varia Ophthalmic Laser with Delivery Devices

and the predicate laser systems.

VIII. Conclusion
The Novus Varia Ophthalmic Laser and Delivery Devices are substantially equivalent to
similar predicate laser devices, delivery systems and accessories. The Novus Varia
Ophthalmic Laser and Delivery Devices share the same intended use, indications for use,
and technological characteristics as the predicate ophthalmic laser systems.

Dear Ms. Baker:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
Lf your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class I]] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CER Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801 and
additionally 21 CFR Part 809.10 for in vitro diagnostic devices), please contact the Office of
Compliance at (301) 594-4659, Additionally, for questions on the promotion and advertising of
your device, please contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4639. Also, please note the
