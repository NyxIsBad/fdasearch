Device Description
The VariLite is a dual wavelength medical diode laser source that delivers laser light
at either 532 nm or 940 nm. Its main components are a laser console, footswitch, and
a variety of fiber optic handpiece delivery devices, including manual handpieces and
the ScanLite Scanner, which are all considered part of the VariLite Laser System.
The VariLite console is also intended to be compatible with other delivery devices
that have been the subject of previous 510(k) applications. These devices include
DioLite 532 handpieces (K964074).
Intended Use/Indications for Use
The VariLite is intended for use in dermatological applications: The 532 nm
wavelength delivered with VariLite handpieces, DioLite 532 handpieces, and the
ScanLite Scanner is indicated for:
e the treatment of vascular lesions including:
-  Telangiectasia - Cherry Angiomas
- Leg Veins -  Neovascularization
- Spider Angiomas - Port Wine Stains
- Roscea - Venous Lakes
e the treatment of benign pigmented lesions including:
- Lentigines - Freckles
- Dermatosis Papulosis Nigra - — Potkloderma of Civatte
-  Café- au- lait Stains - Melasma
e the treatment of cutaneous lesions including:
- Verruca -  Keratoses
- Skin Tags
e the treatment of moderate inflammatory acne vulgaris.
The 940 nm wavelength delivered with VariLite handpieces is indicated for:
e the treatment of vascular lesions including:
-  Telangiectasia - Cherry Angiomas
- Leg Veins -  Neovascularization
- Spider Angiomas - Port Wine Stains
- Roscea - Venous Lakes
¢ the treatment of benign pigmented Iesions including:
-  Lentigines - Freckles
- Dermatosis Papulosis Nigra - — Poikloderma of Civatte
-  Café- au- lait Stains - Melasma
e hair removal
Technological Characteristics and Substantial Equivalence
The Varilite is a dual wavelength diode laser which delivers laser light at the
wavelengths of 532 nm and 940 nm.

The IRIDEX Corporation DioLite 532 delivers a wavelength of 532 nm and is
indicated for the treatment of vascular and pigmented lesions. Thus, it delivers the
same wavelength and has similar indications to those of the VariLite.
The Laserscope Aura delivers laser light at a wavelength of 532 nm and is indicated
for the treatment of vascular and pigmented lesions; for the treatment of cutaneous
lesions; and for the treatment of acne vulgaris. Thus, it delivers the same wavelength
and has similar indications to those of the VariLite.
The Nidek, Inc Prima KTP delivers laser light at a wavelength 532 nm and is
indicated for the treatment of vascular and pigmented lesions and the treatment
cutaneous lesions. Thus it delivers the same wavelength and has similar indications
to those of the VariLite.
The Dornier MedTech Medilas D SkinPulse S delivers laser light at a wavelength of
940 nm. It is indicated for the treatment of vascular and pigmented skin lesions and
for hair removal. Thus it delivers the same infrared wavelength and has similar
indications to those of the VariLite.

Non-Clinical performance Data
Non-clinical performance testing to applicable consensus and voluntary standards is
demonstrated via a Declaration of Conformity.

Clinical performance Data
None

Conclusion
The VariLite is substantially equivalent to predicate devices currently legally marketed
for the intended use/indications for use above.

Dear Mr. Lehtonen:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class If (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may

CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
