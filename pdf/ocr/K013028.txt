Device Trade Name: Palomar SLP™ 1000
Common Name: Super Long Pulse Diode Laser
Classification Name: Laser surgical instrument for use in General and
Plastic Surgery and in Dermatology
(see: 21 CFR 878-4810).
Product Code: GEX
Panel: 79
Legally-Marketed Predicate Device: LightSheer Diode Array Laser
Laserscope Lyra G Surgical Laser System
System Description: The SLP™ 1000 delivers infrared laser light with a
wavelength of 810 nm, a selectable pulse duration
of 50-1000 ms, and a selectable pulse energy of
-5-100 J.
The complete system consists of a power unit,
chiller, a footswitch, and a handpiece connected to
the laser unit with an umbilical. In standard use, the
handpiece is pressed against the patient’s skin and a
light pulse is delivered when the footswitch is
depressed. The handpiece tip is water-cooled to
14

other system features ate controlled from the user
interface panel on top of the power unit, which
provides an interface to the system computer.

Intended Use of the Device: The SLP™ 1000 Diode Laser System is indicated
for the treatment of pseudofolliculitis barbae, as
weil as hair removal, permanent hair reduction,
treatment of pigmented and vascular lesions
(including facial and leg veins).

Performance Data: The differences in the specifications of the SLP™
1000 laser and the predicate device do not result in
different performance or raise new questions of
safety or efficacy.

Conclusion: Based on the foregoing, the SLP™ 1000 Diode
Laser System is substantially equivalent to the
legally-marketed claimed predicate device for
permanent hair reduction.

Dear Ms. Moore:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and we have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the
indications for use stated in the enclosure) to devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to

been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
(Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices,
good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may

CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
