Device Information:

Classification: Class II

Trade Name: Rubicor EnCapsule™ Breast Biopsy Device

Classification Name: Electrosurgical Device and accessories (21 CFR 870.4400)

Equivalent Device:

The subject device and accessory are substantially equivalent in intended use and/or method

of operation to the Rubicor EnCapsule™ Breast Biopsy Device (K023601 & K030049)

Intended Use:

The EnCapsule™ Breast Biopsy Device is intended for diagnostic sampling of breast tissue

during breast biopsy procedures. It is to be used for diagnostic purposes only and is not

intended for therapeutic uses.

The EnCapsule Breast Biopsy Device is indicated to provide breast tissue samples for

diagnostic sampling of breast abnormalities. It is designed to provide breast tissue for

histologic examination with partial or complete removal of the imaged abnormality.

The extent of histologic abnormality cannot be reliably determined from its mammographic

appearance. Therefore, the extent of removal of the imaged evidence of an abnormality

does not predict the extent of removal of a histologic abnormality (e.g., malignancy). When

the sampled abnormality is not histologically benign, it is essential that the tissue margins be

examined for completeness of removal using standard surgical procedures.

Test Results: ,

Performance

Results of in-vitro testing demonstrate that the Rubicor EnCapsule™ Breast Biopsy Device

is safe and effective for its intended function.
