Classification: Class II (21 CFR § 878.4810 Laser Surgical Instrument for use in

General and Plastic Surgery and in Dermatology)
Common Name: Dermatology Laser, Clearbeam Pulse Dye Laser System
Predicate Devices: Candela SPTL-le Pulse Dye Laser (KO11092), SLS Biophile

Ltd NLite (K000811)
Description:
The Clearbeam Pulse Dye laser is a 585 nm pulsed, flash lamp excited dye, medical laser,
controlled by an embedded microprocessor, to be used for the treatment of psoriasis,
telangiectasia, port wine stains, benign cutaneous lesions and other dermatologic applications.
The laser system may be used with the Candela Dynamic Cooling Device, which provides a short
burst of cryogen spray prior to firing the laser pulse. The laser output energy is delivered via an
optical fiber to a handpiece, which produces circular beams with diameters of 5. 7 or 10
millimeters on the skin. The cryogen, which is housed within the laser enclosure, is delivered via
a hose to a nozzle located in the handpiece.
The Candela Clearbeam Pulse Dye Lasers are equipped with safety interlock systems to protect
patients and operators. Users of the device make selections from an onboard control panel to
regulate operation during treatment.
Testing:
As a laser product, the Clearbeam Pulse Dye Laser is required to conform and will conform to the
Laser Performance Standard (21 CFR 1040). In addition the device will conform to the UL 2601
Electrical Safety Standard and with the Harmonized Standard EN 60601-1-2, Part 2 established
by and required by the European Community.
Summary of Substantial Equivalence:

Summary of Substantial Equivalence:
The Candela Clearbeam Laser has the same intended use, utilizes similar operating principles
and matches key design aspects, including similar spot size, the same wavelength and / or the
same maximum delivered power as the predicate devices.
On the basis of similarities in methods of assembly, method of operation, and intended uses,
Candela believes that its Candela Clearbeam Laser System is substantially equivalent to the
predicate devices.
