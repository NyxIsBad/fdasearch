Common/Usual Name: Electrosurgical Instruments
Classification Name: Electrosurgical Cutting and Coagulation Device
and Accessories (21 CFR 878.4400)
Proprietary Name: Everest Bipolar LYONS Dissecting Forceps and
Gyrus Bipolar LYONS Dissecting Forceps
The device is a Class II medical device. The Bipolar LYONS Dissecting
Forceps is a modification to the predicate device cleared under K904993. The
bipolar LYONS Dissecting Forceps is identical in construction (with the
exception of shaft length) and in component materials when compared to the
predicate device. The forceps jaws are electrically isolated from each other
enabling one jaw to act as a return electrode, eliminating the need for a return
pad. The modification has not altered the fundamental technology of the
predicate device cleared under K904993. The intended use, electrosurgical
coagulation, grasping and dissection of the tissue during surgical procedures
is similar to the predicate devices cleared under K904993. The energy source,
bipolar electrosurgical energy, is the same energy type as used for the
predicate devices.
In conclusion, as the design, materials of construction, function and intended
use of the modified bipolar LYONS Dissecting Forceps is similar to that of the
predicate devices currently cleared, Gyrus Medical Inc. believes that no new
issues of safety and effectiveness are raised and that the submitted device is
substantially equivalent.

devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
. general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may

CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
