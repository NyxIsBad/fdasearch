4. Description of the Device
Laparoscopic and electrosurgical instruments are used in various surgical applications. Therefore
they are varying in size and build-up, though the general principle remains unchanged.
By using a suitable connecting cable, the monopolar and bipolar instruments can be connected to
high-frequency electrosurgical generators.
5. Intended Use
Rudolf's laparoscopic and electrosurgical instruments are designed for dissecting, cutting and
optional monopolar or bipolar coagulation of tissue during general surgical procedures.
These devices have not been shown to be effective for tubal sterilization or tubal coagulation for
sterilization procedures and should not be used for these procedures.
6. Performance Standards
The devices are conforming to following international standards:
ANSI/AAMI HF 18, IEC 60601-1, IEC 60601-1-1, IEC 60601-2-2, IEC 60601-2-18
7. Sterilization
Rudolfs laparoscopic and electrosurgical instruments are supplied non-sterile and must be sterilized before every use by a steam sterilization (pre-vacuum) process at 134°C (273°F) and 5 minutes minimum holding time.
8. Conclusion
Based on the available 510(k) summaries and 510(k) statements (21 CFR 807) and the information provided herein, we conclude that Rudolf's Laparoscopic and Electrosurgical Instruments are
substantially equivalent to the existing legally marketed devices under Federal Food, Drug and
Casmetic Act.

Dear Mr. Menean:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRIH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474, For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance
