Contact Person: Thomas Moody

Preparation Date: 12/23/04

Device Submitted: Dermillume Phototherapeutic Lamp

Proprietary Name: Dermillume

Common Name: Blue/Red Light Acne Treatment Lamp

Classification: Class {I Laser surgical instrument for use in General and Plastic
Surgery and in Dermatology. Product code: GEX

Predicate Devices: ClearLight, Phototherapy System, Model Cl 420 (K013623), BLUU, Model 4710 (K031805), Omnilux Blue (K030883), & Omnilux
Red (K030426)

Device Description: The Dermillume Pro1000 device is a compact light source that
delivers high intensity narrow band blue and red light to the body
for the treatment of acne vulgaris. The light sources are narrow
wavelength LEDs that supply a spectral output of 414 + 5 nm
(blue) and 633 + 5 nm (red). The device supplies 20 and 10
mW/cm’ for blue and red light, respectively, at 4.6 inches
distance from the skin surface.

The principal parts of the device are a light unit, positioning arm
and firmware timer to control duration of exposure. Additional offthe-shelf electronic devices related to treatment data acquisition
and storage may be supplied as user options.

Intended Use: The Dermillume Pro1000 phototherapy lamp is intended for
dermatological use by trained licensed practitioners, specifically
for the treatment of mild to moderate inflammatory acne vulgaris.

510(k} Summary, contd.

Performance Data: The performance data obtained from bench testing of the
Dermillume device substantiates that the irradiance at a
practicable distance from the skin surface (4.6”) is comparable
with the cited predicated devices. Additionally, the submission
data demonstrates that the irradiance at the target surface is in
conformance with recommendations of current clinical studies.
The mode of operation, treatment area, and general principles for
the treatment of inflammatory acne vulgaris with this device are
the same as the predicate devices, ClearLight, Phototherapy
System, Model Cl 420 (K013623), BLU-U, Model 4710
(KO31805), Omnilux Blue (K030883) for the reduction and
elimination of the acne-producing bacterium P. acnes.

The Dermillume device combines the inflammatory acne-reducing
properties of blue light with the red light improvement supported
by a recent clinical acne treatment study. The output wavelength
and irradiance are comparable to the predicate device, Omnilux
Red (K030426).

There are no significant adverse reactions observed in clinical
studies using this technology. The device is safe and efficacious.

Substantial Equivalence: The Dermillume Pro1000 phototherapeutic lamp is substantially
equivalent to the cited predicate devices for spectral output, mode
of operation, operating principals as well as general and specific
indications for use. All devices emit visible light for the treatment
of dermatological conditions. Although there are some
differences in the source of the emitted light and output intensity,
these differences are minor and do not raise new questions of
safety or efficacy.

The Dermillume Pro1000 phototherapeutic lamp is substantially
equivalent.
