Proprietary Name: Smith & Nephew intradiscal Catheter System
Common Name: Electrosurgical, Cutting & Coagulation & Accessories
Classification Name and Reference: 21 CFR 888.4400, Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation

device and accessories
Device Product Code and Panel Code: GEl/ Orthopedics / 87
Device Description:
The proposed Intradiscal Catheter System, consisting of the Spinecath Intradiscal Catheter and the
Acutherm Decompression Catheter, is used as part of the Intradiscal Electrothermal Therapy (IDET) and
Targeted Disc Decompression (TDD) procedures. The procedures require the use of an introducer needle
and the ORA-5SOS Electrothermal Spine System Generator or the Smith & Nephew Electrothermal 20S Spine
Generator. The introducer needle transects the disc annulus and assists the surgeon in the placement of
the catheters in the intradiscal space. The ORA-5SOS Electrothermal Spine System Generator or the Smith &
Nephew Electrothermal 20S Spine System delivers radiofrequency energy to the catheters where the
energy is converted to thermal energy.
Intended Use:
The Spinecath Intradiscal Catheter is intended for use for the coagulation and decompression of disc material to
treat symptomatic patients with annular disruption of contained herniated discs.
The Acutherm Decompression Catheter is intended for use for the coagulation and decompression of disc
material to treat symptomatic patients with contained herniated discs.
Technological Characteristics:
The proposed Intradiscal Catheter System isi i dicate Nucleotomy Catheter (KO13622) and
Spinecath Intradiscal Catheter (K993967)
Substantial Equivalence Information:
Performance testing of the proposed tntradiscal Catheter System demonstrates that it performs identically to
the predicate Nucleotomy Catheter (KO13622) and Spinecath Intradiscal Catheter (K993967). Biocompatibility
testing of the proposed device demonstrates that like the predicate devices, the proposed Intradiscat Catheter
System does not pose a substantial biocompatibility risk to patients who undergo an IDET or a TDD procedure.
The results of all performance and biocompatibility testing are enclosed.

Dear Mr. Robbins:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 — Mr. Mason W. Robbins
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance
