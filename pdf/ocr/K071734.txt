Device Description:
The Waterlase®MD Derm medical laser system is a device used to perform a
variety of soft tissue indications. Soft tissue procedures are performed using a
different mode of operation where direct Er,Cr:YSGG laser energy is applied to
incise, excise or ablate these tissues. For soft tissue procedures the water spray is
applied for hydration, cooling or to keep tissues and the field of view clean.
A flexible fiber optic terminated into the handpiece delivers the
Waterlase®MD Derm laser energy to the end fiber tip and target. A visible
aiming light emitted from the handpiece’s distal end pinpoints the area of
treatment. Three fiber optic ports provide illumination from the handpiece to the
tissue site in addition to the center beam emitting source. In soft tissue
applications the power output, pulse duration, repetition rate (frequency) and air
and water flow rates are adjustable to specific user requirements. The spot size
and spot geometry can also be varied by changing tips which include different
diameters and end configurations.

Indications for Use:
Use of the device is indicated for the incision, excision, ablation, vaporization and
coagulation of dermatologic tissues including epidermal nevi, cheilitis, keloids,
verrucae, skin tags, keratosis, scar revision, debulking of tumors, cysts, diagnostic
biopsy and skin resurfacing.
Use of the device is further indicated for the incision, excision, vaporization and
coagulation of soft tissue during general surgical applications where skin incision,
tissue dissection, excision of extemal tumors and lesions, complete or partial
resection of internal organs, tumors and lesions, tissue ablation and/or vessel
coagulation may be indicated.
Cautions, Precautions and Contraindications:
All clinical procedures performed with Waterlase® MD Derm must be subject to
the same clinical judgment and care as with traditional techniques. Patient risk
must always be considered and fully understood before clinical treatment. The
clinician must completely understand the patient's medical history prior to
treatment. Exercise caution for general medical conditions, which might
contraindicate a local procedure, Such conditions may include, but are not limited
to, allergy to local or topical anesthetics, heart disease, lung disease, bleeding
disorders, sleep apnea or an immune system deficiency. Medical clearance from
patient's physician is advisable when doubt exists regarding treatment.
Substantial Equivalence:
The indications included herein are the same as indications that have been
previously cleared by the FDA for other devices. Substantial equivalency for the
Waterlase®MD Derm bas been determined through comparison to previously
cleared devices.

Received: October 30, 2007
Dear Ms. Rizoiu:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance
