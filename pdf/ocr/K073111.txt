Device Description
The Portrait® PSR? is an electro-surgical device for use in dermatological applications. The effect
of the device is achieved by heating the outer layer of the skin so that part or all of the epidermis
becomes non-viable and there is controlled damage to the underlying dermis. Similar biological
changes are produced as with established laser-based and RF-based dermatological surgical
and skin resurfacing technologies.

The system includes:

* Portrait® PSR? Generator-a mobile unit powered from 110/230 VAC standard wall socket
comprising a trolley and lift-out section referred to as a “generator section”. Treatment
parameters are displayed on the control panel.

e Footswitch-a single pedal unit for activation

e Handpiece and Cable Assembly-this carries RF power and Nitrogen gas to the Nozzle.

* Treatment Pack comprising a disposable Nozzle that is connected to the Handpiece and
an electronic “treatment pack key” that is used by the generator to ensure the Nozzle is
not used beyond its validated operational life. The instrument does not touch the skin
during treatment.

e Nitrogen Gas Cylinder - the gas is provided in a cylinder housed in the generator
enclosure. Refill cylinders containing the required purity of Nitrogen are obtained by the
user from a commercial gas product supplier.

Indications for Use Statement
The Portrait? PSR® System is intended for treatment of the following dermatological conditions:

e Treatment of wrinkles and rhytides

e Superficial skin lesions

e Actinic Keratosis

« Viral Papillomata

* Seborrhoeic Keratosis

e Acne Scars
Technological Characteristics
The technology involved in the Portrait? PSR® System is not changed from previous Portrait®
PSR? submissions.
UHF energy from the generator converts Nitrogen gas into plasma within the Handpiece. The
plasma emerges from the Nozzle at the distal end of the Handpiece and is directed onto the skin
to be treated. Rapid heating of the skin occurs as the excited gas gives up energy to the skin.
Through the combination within the Handpiece of precisely controlled energy and Nitrogen gas,
individual plasma pulses are produced that will give predictable tissue effects.
The Portrait? PSR*® uses Nitrogen plasma as compared to laser light used by UltraPulse,
CoolTouch ND:YAG and Fraxel ISR Laser System.

Substantial Equivalence Comparison
Portrait® PSR® utilizes the same technology as previously cleared for Portrait® PSR°, There have
been no changes to the device design. The substantial equivalence of this device is supported
by the prior approval of this device and the clinical data submitted. Other devices used to treat
acne scars include the 1320-nmNd:YAG (K030453), Fraxel SR 1500 (K070284) and CO2 Laser
(K963339).
Clinical and Non-Clinical Data
Clinical studies demonstrated that the Portrait® PSR° is capable of producing tissue effects
similar to that seen with carbon dioxide laser treatment. Clinical studies to support clinical
performance of the Portrait® PSR* to improve acne scarring were conducted as Non-Significant
Risk studies and undertaken in compliance with the Code of Federal Regulations, as specified in
21 CFR 812. These studies conclude that the Portrait® PSR® is safe and effective for treating
acne scars.

Received: March 04, 2008
Dear Mr. Zoletti:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 — Mr. Robert Zoletti
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 51 0(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market. :
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance
at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address
