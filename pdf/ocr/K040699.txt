510(k): Reusable Uncoated Laparoscopic Electrodes

C. Device Name
Common Name: Device, electrosurgical, cutting & coagulation &
accessories
Trade Name: Laparoscopic Electrode, Reusable Indicator Shaft
(LERIS)
Classification (if known): 21 CFR 878.4400, Electrosurgical cutting and
coagulation device and accessories
D. Predicate Devices
Megadyne’s E-Z Clean Laparoscopic Electrode, cleared for marketing via 510(k)
#(K913281) and, Electrosurgical Cutting and Coagulation Device, cleared for
marketing via 510(k) #K943055.
E. Applicant Device Description
The Reusable Uncoated Laparoscopic Electrodes are stainless steel electrosurgical
electrodes insulated over the majority of their length to protect against unwanted
current paths. The insulation has a patented indication layer that aids in
determining the electrode’s end-of-life. The reusable uncoated laparoscopic
electrode tip has the intended geometry for cutting and coagulation and is offered
in several configurations. The electrodes are intended for general laparoscopic
electrosurgical use, and designed to fit into industry standard electrosurgical
pencils and/or foot cables distributed by various manufacturers.
F. Applicant Device Intended Use
Reusable Uncoated Laparoscopic Electrodes are intended to be used in general
laparoscopic surgical procedures requiring the use of electrosurgical cutting
and/or coagulation.
The electrodes are reusable; they are intended to be cleaned, sterilized, and reused.
G. Technological Characteristics
The Reusable Uncoated Laparoscopic Electrode shares the same technological
characteristic found in the predicate devices. It is an electrode provided with
various uncoated tip configurations and a shaft that includes the patented indicator
shaft technology. The indicator shaft provides a safe method to utilize the
electrode without compromising safety. This is accomplished by exposing a
visible yellow layer indicating that the primary insulation has reached the end of
its life.

Dated: March 12, 2004
Received: March 17, 2004
Dear Ms. Magneson:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to :
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class If (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 - Ms. Ronda K. Magneson .
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
“"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
