Device Trade Name: Profile 1064 Laser System

Common Name: Nd:YAG Laser System

Classification Name: Laser Surgical Instrument, 21 CFR 878.4810.

Legally Marketed Sciton’s laser systems (K002853, K003046 & K010285).

Predicate Device: Altus Medical Aesthetic Nd:YAG Lasers (K991234,
K991798, K003202 and K014040 and K022226);
Lyra/Orion Laser Systems manufactured by Laserscope
(K990718, K990903, KO03147, KO03765, KO10284,
K010834 and K020021);
and VeinLase, manufactured by HGM (K981952).

Description of Profile Laser System is an Nd:YAG laser producing

Profile Laser System: emission at a wavelength of 1064nm. It consists of a laser
console, internal computer, control panel and display, an
optical delivery system comprised of an articulated arm
and a handpiece or scanner with cooling capability, and a
footswitch.

Intended Use: The Profile 1064 Laser Systems and Accessories are
intended for use in the medical specialties of general and
plastic surgery, dermatology, endoscopic/laproscopic
general surgery, gastroenterology, gynecology,
otorhinolaryngology (ENT), neurosurgery, oculoplastics,
orthopedics, pulmonary/thoracic surgery and urology for
surgical and aesthetic applications.

Dermatology:

Coagulation and hemostasis of benign vascular lesions
such as, but not limited to port wine stains, hemangiomas,
warts, telangiectasia, rosacea, venus lake, leg veins and
spider veins. The lasers are also intended for the treatment
of benign pigmented lesions such as, but not limited to,
lentigos (age spots), solar lentigos (sun spots), café au lait
macules, seborrheic keratoses, nevi, chloasma, verrucae,
skin tags, keratoses, tattoos (significant reduction in the
intensity of black and/or blue/black tattoos) and plaques.
Additionally, the lasers are indicated for pigmented lesions
to reduce lesion size, for patients with lesions that would
potentially benefit from aggressive treatment, and for
patients with lesions that have not responded to other laser
treatments.

Reduction of red pigmentation in hypertrophic and keloid
scars where vascularity is an integral part of the scar.
Removal of unwanted hair, for the stable long term, or
permanent hair reduction through selective targeting of
melanin in hair follicles, and for the treatment for
pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB). The Profile 1064 Laser
Systems and Accessories are indicated for use on all skin
types (Fitzpatrick I-VI), including tanned skin.

The Profile 1064 Laser Systems and Accessories are
indicated for the treatment of facial wrinkles.

The intended use of the contact cooling system in the
Profile handpiece is to provide cooling of the skin prior to,
during and after laser treatment, for the epidermal
protection and reduction of pain during laser treatment, to
allow for the use of higher fluences for laser treatments
such as hair removal and vascular lesions, and to reduce
the potential side effects of laser treatments.

Surgical Applications:

Incision/excision and cutting, ablation,
coagulation/hemostasis of soft tissue in the performance of
surgical applications in endoscopy/aparoscopy,
gastroenterology, general surgery, head and
neck/otorhinolaryngology (ENT), neurosurgery,
oculoplastics, orthopedics, plastic surgery,
pulmonary/thoracic surgery, gynecology (e.g. menorrhagia)
and urology.

Rationale for Substantial The Profile Laser System and Accessories share the same
Equivalence: indications for use and technological characteristics and is
therefore substantially equivalent according to 510(k)
guidelines to the above legally marketed predicate
devices.
Safety and Effectiveness The above indications for use are based upon the
Information: indications for use for predicate laser systems.
The technological characteristics are identical to previous
predicate Sciton’s laser systems (KO02853, K003046 &
K010285). As a result, the risks and benefits are
comparable to the predicate devices.
We therefore conclude that there are no issues of safety or
effectiveness raised by the introduction of this device.

Dear Mr. Patel:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class If (Special Controls) or class Ifl (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
