Date of Summary January 14, 2009
Product Code GEX
Classtfication Name Laser Instrument, Surgical Powered
Common Name Surgical Laser Instrument
Proprietary Name SOLAR™ Surgical Ablation System
Description of Device:
The SOLAR Surgical Ablation System consists of a Cart, Laser Energy Generator (Laser
Generator), Controller, an infusion set and a Track The Track 1s an intraoperative, sterile,
single-use device designed to apply laser energy to tissue The infusion set 1s a single-use device
having a sterile fluid path designed for the delivery of sterile saline solution to the Track laser
tip The Track includes a rigid metallic shaft, a flexible track, and an mtroducer (guiding
obturator) The Track further includes a laser compatible optical fiber which attaches to the
Laser Generator The emitted laser energy 1s directed toward the targeted tissue from the end of
the optical fiber which ndes within the flexible Track The position of the optical fiber in
relation to the target tissue 1s maintamed constant by the method of mounting the fiber within the
fiber optic housing and the design of the flexible Track itself The black markers on the Track
indicate the area of tissue to be ablated and are used to set the positioning of the fiber optic
housing within a given area of tissue The lines of ablation are created by independently
activating the laser energy between two numbered segments, which are predetermined by the
physician when positioning the flexible Track against the targeted tissue

Statement of Intended Use:
The SOLAR™ Surgical Ablation System 1s indicated for delivery of 810nm, 1064nm or 1083nm
laser light to soft tissue, under visualization, during surgical procedures Indications include the
ablation, or coagulation of soft tissue
The SOLAR™ Surgical Ablation System Accessories are intended for use in the support of the
delivery of laser light to soft tissue during surgical procedures
Warning:

The SOLAR™ Surgical Ablation System ts not indicated for the treatment of cardiac
arrhythmias

The risk of actual damage to adjacent organs from the instrument exists and perforation,
rupture or tearmg of tissue, may occur as a complication of laser use Burns can occur if the laser
energy 1s not correctly applied These complications may be serious
Technological Comparison:

The SOLAR Surgical Ablation System was compared to the current ATRILAZE Surgical
Ablation System (K081457) and SOLAR Surgical Ablation System (K061489)

Both the currently available device and the SOLAR system as reviewed 1n this 510(k) are
provided sterile with a sterile fluid path for saline delivery at the laser tip Both fiber optic
delivery systems utilize the same laser energy generator and are connected via an SMA 905
connector to deliver laser energy to the target tissue

For purposes of this submission, the SOLAR Surgical Ablation System was compared to
the following predicate devices

SOLAR Surgical Ablation System (K061489)

ATRILAZE Surgical Ablation System (K081457)

Testing:

‘ Testing demonstrated that adherence to specifications was demonstrated and the lesions
obtained using the SOLAR system with 1083nm laser light are substantially equivalent to those
obtained with the currently cleared ATRILAZE Surgical Ablation System wavelengths
