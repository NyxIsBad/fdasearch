Dear Mr. Nock:

Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket
approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general
controls provisions of the Act. ‘The gencral controls provisions of the Act include
requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice,
labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class I] (Special Controls) or class II
(PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls, Existing major regulations affecting

Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not
mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements
of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies.
You must comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration
and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice
requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if
applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act);
21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a
legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits
your device to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801),
please contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation
