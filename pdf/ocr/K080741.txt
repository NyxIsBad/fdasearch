E. Predicate Devices
The predicate devices include:
Megadyne’s Mega 2000™ Soft Patient Return Electrode Pad which was
cleared for marketing via 510(k) # K021077 by FDA’s Office of Device
Evaluation on April 17, 2002;
Megadyne’s Mega 2000™ Soft Dual Cord Patient Return Electrode Pad
which was cleared for marketing via 510(k) # K031285 by FDA’s Office
of Device Evaluation on May 19, 2003;
Valleylabs E7512 Neonatal REM Polyhesive II Patient Return which was
cleared for marketing via 510(k) #K994428 by FDA’s Office of Device
Evaluation on March 7, 2000; and
Leonard Lang’s Skintact® Cool Contact Electrosurgical Grounding Plates
with NH 04 gel which was cleared for marketing via 510(k) # K063161 by
FDA’s Office of Device Evaluation on November 26, 2006.
F, Applicant Device Description
The Mega Soft Patient Return Electrode is constructed of a layer of conductive
material strain-relieved with two sheets of urethane material, and sealed between
two asymmetric layers of a viscoelastic polymer called Akton®. (The top layer of
polymer is thinner than the bottom layer.) The Akton polymer is encapsulated by
a layer of urethane film. One or two two-conductor cables connects the
conductive layer of the device to a two conductor DetachaCable™. The
DetachaCable is connected to a standard monopolar electrosurgical unit (ESU).
The device cable is insulated, strain-relieved, and connected well inside the
device to prevent patient or user burns. In use, this device will lay on the
operating surface with the patient lying on top, on the side labeled “patient side”.
The adult-size device is large enough to extend at least the length and width of a
typical patient torso. Pad size is approximately 20” x 46” x 4”. The pediatricsize device is approximately 12” x 26” x 44” and is intended. for pediatric patients
weighing between 0.8 and 50 lbs.
G. Applicant Device Intended Use
The intended use of the Mega Soft Patient Return Electrode is to conduct
monopolar electrosurgical energy from target tissue of a patient back to an
electrosurgical unit (ESU), or generator. At the same time, the product reduces
the risk of pressure related injury due to immobility during surgery.
This device is intended to be used whenever monopolar electrosurgy is indicated.
Electrosurgical use is restricted to use with isolated monopolar electrosurgical
generators. The device is not indicated for RF ablation.

Hi. Technological Characteristics
The proposed device shares the same technological characteristics found in the
Megadyne predicate devices.
I. Safety information
Questions of safety and effectiveness are the same for this device as they are for
the predicate devices and other patient return electrodes on the market. There are
no new technologies incorporated into the device.
Megadyne has conducted extensive testing to ensure conformance to the ,
voluntary standard ISO 60601-2-2:2006, Medical electrical equipment, Part 2:
Particular requirements for the safety of high frequency surgical equipment, and
, ANSI/ AAMI HF 18-2001, Electrosurgical Devices.

Dear Ms. Magneson:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and .
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class Il] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050,

Page 2 - Ms. Ronda K. Magneson : .
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described-in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
