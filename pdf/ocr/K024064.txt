Name of the Device: Polaris DS
Predicate Devices: | The Polaris DS is substantially equivalent to a combination of
four laser powered surgical instruments (21 CFR 878.4810,
procode GEX): Aurora DS, manufactured by Syneron Medical
Ltd. and subject of K021149; SLP 1000, manufactured by
Palomar Medical Technologies Inc. and subject of K013028;
PhotoGenica DL, manufactured by Cynosure Inc. and subject
of K010005; Dornier Medilas D  SkinPulse Laser,
manufactured by DornierMedTech, and subject of K003993.
Device Description: The Polaris DS is a device that is used for non invasive hair
removal. The Polaris DS treatment is based on the principle of
selective (electromagnetic) thermolysis. According to this
principle, parameters of optical and RF energy (spectrum,
exposure duration and energy density) are chosen and
optimized to selectively damage to the hair follicle without
damaging the surrounding tissues.
The Polaris DS is intended for use in dermatology for non invasive hair removal.
Based upon an analysis of the overall performance characteristic for the device,
Syneron Medical Ltd. believes that no significant differences present. Therefore the
Polaris DS should raise no new issues of safety or effectiveness.

Dear Dr. Waldman:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and we have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the
indications for use:stated in the enclosure) to devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to
May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have
been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
(Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices,
good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class HII (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
