9. Predicate Device (legally marketed comparison device)
Zap Lasers, Inc. believes that the following surgical laser systems are substantially equivalent to the
Stpla MicroLase™’/OrthoLase™- surgical diode system.
1. SOFT LASE G2 (K021227, ZAP Lasers, Inc.); 2. ODYSSEY NAVIGATOR (K062258,

10. Summary of Equivalence:
There are no unique applications, indications, material or specifications presented herein. Evidence of
equivalence has been demonstrated through:
© The Stpla MicroLase™/StylaOrtho™ intended use and indications for use were previously
cleared by FDA for the predicate devices.
e The technical characteristics of the Stpla MicroLase™/StylaOrtho™ are similar to those of the
cleared Odyssey Navigator and the EZLase.
«Laser output values of the Stvla MicroLase™/StylaOrtho™ are well within previously cleared
values of the predicate dental laser system as described.
e The predicate devices and other previously cleared laser systems with similar power outputs have
a proven safety and effectiveness in the treatment of the claimed indications.
e Safety and performance testing.
Therefore, the Styla MicroLase™/StylaOrtho™ is substantially equivalent to its predicate devices cited
above and raises no new safety and/or effectiveness issues.
11. Device Description:
The progress achieved in recent years in fiber optics and diode lasers technology has made it
possible to have commercial devices with multi-watt output power in near-infrared spectrum
from about 0.5-mm diameter single-core fiber.
This laser technology is now being used in many areas of medicine and dentistry, particularly
oral surgery, arthroscopy, gastroenterology, péneral surgery, dermatology and plastic
surgery. The intended uses of these laser devices include hemostasis, incision, excision,

ablation, vaporization, and coagulation of tissue. In dentistry, usage of laser devices ranges

from cosmetic surgery to treating periodontal disease.

As the dental laser industry grows, there is an increased demand for portable soft tissue

lasers. In today’s market, customers want a more portable laser solution to avoid office

clutter and to reduce setup time. It has also become apparent that a relatively low-power laser

(2.0 maximum watts and 808 nm) covers the vast majority of laser surgical requirements.

The Styla MicroLaser™/ StylaOrtho™ are the first soft-tissue laser developed as a handheld

unit. It is wireless, lightweight, easy to set up, simple to use, requires less power, and cost

efficient.

With the Styla MicroLaser™/StylaOrtho™ Zap Lasers introduces a miniature X-Y adjusting

module for coupling a diode laser with a disposable fiber. Fiber accuracy is better than 5S um

and the alignment is extremely stable. A module with a specific lens was developed by Zap

Lasers in order to achieve such precision and alignment. Such a design greatly simplifies

the fiber management and setup of operatory time as the fiber is attached into the tip allowing

this item to be disposable and simple to be used. No fiber scoring is needed as the disposable

tip is provided already scored to decrease setup tip and user’s error.

Laser and Control Box:

The Laser and Control Box comprise the following major modules:

The laser diode assembly contains one single emitter laser diode of 2.0 watt output power (Class IV
. laser) lasing at 808 nm. The diode laser is directly coupled to a lens and aligned to the fiber optic

inside the removable tips, using (patent pending) a 2 axis laser alignment system. It also contains a 5

mW power, 650 nm laser diode coupled to the same fiber optic. The laser’s visible light is designed to

aid the user to aim the tip of the delivery fiber onto the tissue.

The Styla Microlaser™/StylaOrtho™ is designed to dissipate heat during normal operation and may

feel warm to the touch after prolonged use. The laser module is mounted towards the tip of the unit,

which acts as a heat sink during normal operation. The temperature is monitored by a sensor that

prevents overheating.

Laser power controller provides electric power to the diodes in continuous wave and pulsed mode. It

supplies about 2 VDC and current up to 4A to the diodes. The controller contains a high efficiency

DC to DC converter that converts the battery voltage to the precise voltage needed for laser operation.

This ensures that the majority of the energy is used for light and not converted into heat.

The delivery tips with fiber built in consist of 400 micron core multi-mode optical fiber, and a precise

alignment mechanism. The fiber is factory installed into the tip and requires no installation by the end

user.

The foot-switch is a standard (UL-approved) commercial foot-switch that provides hands-free

the delivery fiber wirelessly.

Dear Mr. Christensen:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class If (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
