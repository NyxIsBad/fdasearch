2. Name of Device
Trade or Proprietary Name: LigaSure™ Vessel Sealing System
Common/Classification Name: Electrosurgical Cutting and Coagulation Device
and Accessories
3. Predicate Devices
The LigaSure™ Vessel Sealing System is substantially equivalent to the following
legally marketed medical devices:
e¢ LigaSure™ Vessel Sealing System (K981916)
4, Device Description
The LigaSure™ Vessel Sealing System consists of a microprocessor-based radiofrequency (RF) generator and a selection of instruments designed to be used
exclusively with the LigaSure™ generator. All of the instruments are capable of sealing
vessels up to, and including, 7mm, and tissue bundles as large as can fit in the jaws of
each instrument. When a LigaSure™ instrument is applied to a vessel or tissue bundle
and RF energy is applied, the collagen and elastin in the tissues are reformed by heat
and pressure to fuse vessel walls, thereby forming a permanent seal. The
microprocessor in the generator monitors the tissue properties, stops the application of
energy, and allows a brief period of cooling before indicating that the seal cycle is
complete.
No changes are being made to the design or operation of any of the devices within the
current system. The change as proposed in this 510(k) notification is to the intended
use as described above and the resulting labeling changes.

5. Intended Use
The LigaSure™ Vessel Sealing System inciudes a bipolar electrosurgical generator and
dedicated bipolar electrosurgical instruments intended for use in general, laparoscopic
and gynecologic surgical procedures where ligation of vessels, including lymph vessels,
is desired. The system creates a vessel ligation (seal) by the application of bipolar
electrosurgical RF energy (coagulation) to vessels interposed between the jaws of the
device. The generator can also be used with standard bipolar devices where bipolar
cutting or coagulation is desired.
The indications for use include general (including urologic, thoracic, plastic and
reconstructive), laparoscopic, and gynecological procedures where ligation of vessels is
performed, including such procedures as bowel resections, hysterectomies (both vaginal
and abdominal), laparoscopic cholesystectomies, taparoscopically assisted vaginal
hysterectomies, gall bladder procedures, Nissen fundoplication, adhesiolysis,
oophorectomy, etc. The devices can be used on vessels up to 7mm and bundles as
large as will fit in the jaws of the instruments.

6. Summary of Technological Characteristics
The technological characteristics of the LigaSure™ Vessel Sealing System have not
been modified.

7. Performance and Clinical Data
Pre-clinical studies have shown that the LigaSure™ Vessel Sealing System effectively
seals lymphatic vessels, producing seals with burst pressures substantially greater than
the physiologic pressures in the vessels.

Regulation Number: 21 CFR 878.4400
Regulation Name: Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation device and accessories
Regulatory Class: II
Product Code: GEI
Dated: November 24, 2004
Received: November 26, 2004
Dear Mr. Vinson:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class IJ (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 - Mr. Herbert W. Vinson
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
