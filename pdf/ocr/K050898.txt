E. Description of Device
The Smith & Nephew Vulcan Articular Cartilage Probe is a single-use, monopolar
radiofrequency probe which incorporates a pivoting ceramic head with an
embedded RF electrode; protective sheath: and integrated cable. It requires a split
ground pad and it is designed for use only with the Smith & Nephew Vulcan
Generator.
F. Intended Use
The Smith & Nephew Vulcan Articular Cartilage Probe is indicated for arthroscopic
chondroplasty procedures in the knee, shoulder, wrist, hip, etc.
G. Comparison of Technological Characteristics
The Smith & Nephew Vulcan Articular Cartilage Probe is similar to the Smith &
Nephew Vulcan TAC C Il Probe in that both devices are monopolar, single use
devices. Both probes require a split grounding pad and are designed for use only
with the Smith & Nephew Vulcan Generator. The Smith & Nephew Vulcan Articular
Cartilage Probe represents a specific indication for use within the scope of the
cleared indications for the Smith & Nephew TAC C Il Probe. A major technological
difference between the two probes is that the Smith & Nephew Vulcan TAC C II
Probe is temperature controlled and the Smith & Nephew Vulcan Articutar Cartilage
Probe is power controlled. Bench testing confirms substantial equivalence in
performance characteristics.
H. Summary Performance Data
There are no known performance standards or special controls promulgated under
section 415 of the Act for this device. The device was tested and found to be in
compliance with ISO 10993-1, ANSI/AAMI HF-18 and IEC 60601-2-2. At the time of
commercialization, the device will be incompliance with applicable sterilization
standards.

Dear Mr. Vugt:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class If (PMA),
it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device
can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA
may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean

or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
