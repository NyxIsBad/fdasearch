510(K) SUMMARY kKO0304aA3
This summary of 510(k) safety and effectiveness information is being submitted in
accordance with the requirements of SMDA 1990 and 21 CFR §807.92.
The assigned 510(k) number is: .
1. Submitter's Identification:
Preswede AB
Humlegatan 15
501 10 Boras, Sweden
Date Summary Prepared: February 6, 2003
2. Name of the Device:
Powerlite 600® EP System.
3. Predicate Device Information:
K#963249, Epilight™ Hair Removal System, ESC Medical Systems, Yokneam
Industrial Park, Yokneam 20692, ISRAEL.
4. Device Description:
The Powerlite 600® EP System delivers pulsed light at a wavelength beginning
at a wavelength of 600nm. The device consists of three interconnected sections:
the system console which houses the internal cooling system, power supply and
micro-controller, the handle hose to the handpiece, and the handpiece, which
houses the waveguide.
5. Intended Use:
The Powerlite 600® EP System is used for the removal of unwanted hair.
6. Comparison to Predicate Devices:
The Powerlite 600® EP and the Epilight devices are very similar or identical in
terms of the device structure and its technology. Both systems are electrooptical medical devices designed for effective photothermal treatment of
unwanted hair and its removal. Both devices deliver intense pulsed light, broad
spectrum light, starting from 590nm or 600nm, with sufficient energy to be
absorbed in the hair follicles and penetrate deeply enough and at a temperature
high enough to denature and impair hair growth without damaging surrounding
skin.

A main difference between Powerlite 600® EP and Epilight devices is the type of
control terminal. The Powerlite 600® EP System is LCD touch panel controlled,
while the Epilight system is terminal —controlled.

7. Discussion of Non-Clinical Tests Performed for Determination of
Substantial Equivalence are as follows:
Electrical and EMC testing per IEC 60601-1 and IEC 60601-1-2 requirements

8. Discussion of Clinical Tests Performed:
Non-Applicable

9. Conclusions:
The Powerlite 600@ EP System has the same intended use and similar
characteristics as the Epilight™ Hair Removal System. Moreover,
documentation supplied in this submission demonstrates that any differences in
their technological characteristics do not raise any new questions of safety or
effectiveness. Thus, the Powerlite 600@ EP System is substantially equivalent to
the predicate device.

Dear Ms. Goldstein-Falk:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,

: and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean

or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation contro! provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
