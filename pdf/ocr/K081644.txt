4, Device Description:
The Beamer Argon Probe consists of a stainless steel wire that extends
from the probe connector to the distal end of the probe. The proximal end
of the stainless steel wire is soldered into the connector body. The distal
end of the wire is crimped to an electrode located at the distal end of the
probe. The distal end of the Beamer Argon Probe has a ceramic tip which
provides a thermal insulation barrier for the tubing to prevent heat
degradation during coagulation. The electrode remains recessed in the
ceramic tip such that there is no tissue contact during the procedure.
There are several configurations of the Beamer Argon Probe. The probes
vary in length and outside diameter to accommodate the procedure
performed by the physician. The Beamer Argon Probes are provided
sterile by ethylene oxide and are single use only.
5. Intended Use:
The Beamer™ Argon Probes are indicated for argon enhanced
coagulation of tissue.

6. Comparison of Technological Characteristics:

The Beamer Argon Probes are substantially equivalent to the predicate

devices both in intended use, technological characteristics and materials.
7. Performance Testing:

Biocompatibility and bench testing have been performed to demonstrate

equivalence of the Beamer Argon Probes to their predicate devices. All

testing passed the predetermined performance specifications.

‘Trade/Device Name: Beamer’ Argon Probe

Regulation Number: 21 CFR 878.4400

Regulation Name: Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation device and accessories

Regulatory Class: II

Product Code: GEI

Dated: August 28, 2008

Received: August 29, 2008
Dear Mr, Lehtonen:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, ,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 — Mr. Daniel W. Lehtonen
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Healih’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’ s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464, You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance
: at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address
