The Ellman Surgitron is a compact source of high power RF energy to be
employed for a variety of radiosurgical procedures. This action is achieved ;
by front panel selection of waveforms and power levels. All selections are
activated by push buttons with lights that give the operator feedback of
operative status. ;
: The power level for each mode is indicated by the front panel digital display,
. which also identifies the status of self-test and monitoring. This display is
interlocked with the controls to prevent operation when fail is displayed.
, The final output power control is made through foot and/or hand switches.
Both monopolar and bipolar electrodes are provided.
The subject device is packaged with the following items: ‘
o Ellman Surgitron IEC 120 / 4.0 DU Radiofrequency Generator /
: o IEC Power Cord
o Dual Footswitch & Cable
o IEC Foot controlled Handpiece /
o Bipolar Cable
/ © Disposable Neutral Plate
o Instruction Manual
o Three Button Fingerswitch Handpiece
. Intended Use [21 CFR 807.92(a)(5)]
. The device has the following "Indications For Use":
o Non-ablative treatment of mild to moderate facial wrinkles and rhytids
for skin phototypes I-IV
The device is also indicated for:
o Cutting: snoring, submucosal palatal shrinkage, traditional
uvulopalatoplasty (RAUP), myringotomy with effective hemorrhage
control, epistaxis treatment, turbinate shrinkage, skin incisions, biopsy, .
cysts, abscesses, tumors, cosmetic repairs, development of skin flaps,
_ skin tags and blepharoplasty.
o Blended Cutting and Coagulation: snoring, submucosal palatal
shrinkage, traditional uvulopalatoplasty (RAUP), myringotomy with

Technological Characteristics [21 CFR 807.92(a)(6)]
Ellman International believes that the subject device is substantially
equivalent to the predicate devices.
Performance Data [21 CFR 807.92(b)(1)}

such as the treatment of mild to moderate facial wrinkles and rhytids.
Predicate Device [21 CFR 807.92(a)(3)1 /
The predicate devices are as follows:
o Ellman Surgitron IEC 120 / 4.0 DU — K013255
o Thermage ThermaCool — K040135
. The device is identical (materials, technology) to the Surgitron device in
K013255. The only difference is the addition of the non-ablative indications
for use.
The subject device is adding indications for use similar to the Thermage
. Thermacool device as found in K040135.
Conclusion [21 CFR 807.92(b)(3)] .
Based on the aforementioned information, the Ellman International
Surgitron, with its expanded "Indication For Use" is safe and effective and .
substantially equivalent to the identified predicate devices.

devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, ~
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the-general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
