Device Description: RA Medical Systems, Inc.’s PHAROS Excimer Laser is a medical
laser that is a self-contained UV laser light source that emits a
wavelength*of 308 nm. The PHAROS Excimer Laser utilizes a
XeCl gas mixture to generate an operator-selected dose and targetspecific UV light. The laser dose is activated by a footswitch with
the therapeutic radiation emitting from a handheld device. The
laser operation is key controlled and is contained within an
interlocked housing. oo 
Intended Use: UVB phototherapy for the treatment of psoriasis, vitiligo, atopic
dermatitis and leukoderma.

Substantial Equivalence: The PHAROS Excimer Laser, from both a design and clinical
perspective, uses similar or identical technology as the cited
predicate devices and has the same intended uses. Based upon the
predicted overall performance characteristics for the PHAROS
Excimer Laser, RA Medical Systems, Inc. believes that no
Significant differences exists between PHAROS and the cited
predicate devices.

Product Performance Testing: Testing conducted on the PHAROS EX-308 laser
shows that it conforms to the relevant applicable standard.

Clinical Performance Testing: the indications requested have been previously cleared
in predicate devices. The PHAROS EX-308 does not introduce
atiy new indications for use; and will clinically parton eqiivalant 60°"
to the predicate devices.

Conclusions; The PHAROS EX-308 Excimer laser uses a similar or identical
technology as the predicate devices. Therefore, RA Medicals
Systems, Inc.’s PHAROS Excimer laser should not raise any
concerns regarding the safety and effectiveness of the laser to treat
