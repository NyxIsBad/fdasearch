2. Device Name
Proprietary Name: pureWrist™ electrocautery laparoscopic instruments
Common/Usual Name: Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation device and
accessories
3. Identification of Predicate or Legally Marketed Device
The Cambridge Endoscopic Devices, Inc. pureWrist™ electrocautery
laparoscopic instruments are substantially equivalent to the Ethicon EndoSurgery, Inc. ENDOPATH® Endoscopic Instruments cleared and under
K984240.
4. Device Description
The pureWrist™ electrocautery laparoscopic instruments are sterile, single
use disposable instruments for use through appropriately sized surgical
trocars. The instruments consist of a rotating insulated shaft with a 5mm
diameter. The distal end of the shaft has the respective end effector
attached (scissors, dissector, or hook). The proximal end of the shaft is
attached to an ergonomically shaped handle with a rotating knob that
allows the shaft to rotate 360 degrees in either direction. The handle
contains the actuation mechanism for the respective end effector. The lever
on the handle is compressed and released to activate the instrument jaws
or scissor blades. Each instrument has a monopolor cautery connector that
extends from the bottom of the handle. The connector is used for
electrosurgery when properly attached to a standard cautery cable and
proper generator.
5. Intended Use
The pureWrist™ electrocautery laparoscopic instruments have application
in a variety of minimally invasive procedures to facilitate grasping,
mobilization, dissection, and transection of tissue.

6. Comparison of Technological Characteristics A
The pureWrist™ electrocautery laparoscopic instruments have the same
. technological characteristics as the predicate devices. Each of the devices
are scissors, graspers, or dissectors that coagulate tissue using monopolar
technology. Each use sharp objects to permit the surgeon to cut or dissect
tissue. Each of the devices are connected to the same or similar
electrosurgical generators and use similar power ranges for operation. The
devices have the same intended use, indications for use, technological
features including similar design, performance, and material characteristics
which further supports the concept of substantial equivalence.
7. Performance Testing
Pre-ciinical testing was used to evaluate performance to ensure that the
device can be used as designed. The testing evaluated ergonomics of the
handle and rotating knob, tissue trauma, grasping and dissecting ability,
and electrical insulation requirements. The studies demonstrated ;
acceptable reliability and design performance relative to the predicate
device.
8. Statement of Equivalency
Based on the design and intended use, the Cambridge Endoscopic
Devices, Inc. pureWrist™ electrocautery laparoscopic instruments are
substantially equivalent to the Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. ENDOPATH®
instruments cleared under K984240.

Dear Mr. Jacobson:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class If (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
