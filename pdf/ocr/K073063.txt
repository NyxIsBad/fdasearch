Intended Use / Indications for Use
The Ceralas D1470 is a diode laser that is intended for delivery of laser light
to soft tissue in non-contact mode during general surgery procedures. The
device is indicated for the treatment of reflux of the saphenous veins
associated with varicose veins and varicosities.

Technological Characteristics
The Ceralas D1470 has substantially similar technological characteristics as
compared to the CoolTouch CTEV Nd:YAG laser, the CoolTouch CT3S
Nd:YAG laser, and the Sciton, Inc., Profile Multi-Platform System. The
Ceralas D1470 contains an ELVeS Kit for gaining access to the vasculature
to treat varicose veins and varicosities associated with superficial reflux of
the saphenous veins.

Performance Data
Performance testing of the Ceralas D1470 demonstrates no significant
difference as compared to the cleared CoolTouch CTEV Nd:YAG laser, the
CoolTouch CT3S Nd:YAG laser, and the Sciton, Inc., Profile Multi-Platform
System.

Substantial Equivalence

The Ceralas D1470 is as safe and effective as the CoolTouch CTEV Nd:YAG
laser, the CoolTouch CT3S Nd:YAG laser, and the Sciton, Inc., Profile MultiPlatform System. The Ceralas D1470 has the same intended uses and
similar indications, technological characteristics, and principles of operation
as its predicate devices. The minor technological differences between the
Ceralas D1470 and its predicate device raises no new issues of safety or
effectiveness. Thus, the Ceralas D1470 is substantially equivalent.

Dear Mr. Kahan:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation contro! provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance
