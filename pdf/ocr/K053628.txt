System Description:

The LightSheer Duet Laser System is a non-invasive aesthetic laser. The system delivers
pulsed infrared laser light with a wavelength ranging from 790 — 950 nm (800 nm
nominal) and has two unique treatment handpieces. One handpiece is the LightSheer®
ET™ handpiece, which delivers laser energy through a 9 x 9 mm tip up to 90J
maximum. The settings for this handpiece are selectable pulse duration from 5 — 400 ms,
selectable fluence from 10 — 100 J/cm2 and a pulse repetition rate up to 3 Hz maximum.
The second handpiece is the LightSheer® HS™ handpiece, which delivers laser energy
from a 22 x 35 mm diode array up to 45 J maximum. The settings for this handpiece are
pulse duration from 10 - 30 ms, selectable fluence from 3 - 5.2 J/cem2 and multiple
pulsing up to 3 pulses.

The complete system consists of a console and two handpieces connected to the system
by umbilical cables. In standard use, the handpiece is pressed against the patient’s skin
and a pulse of light is delivered. To initiate energy output, the system requires
redundant activation of the handpiece enable button and the handpiece trigger button
while the system is in the Ready mode. The LightSheer ET handpiece tip is watercooled to provide active skin cooling. The LightSheer HS handpiece tip uses vacuum
and lower laser energy densities which reduces skin heating. The physician is able to
control the settings of laser energy from the LCD display on the main console.
Intended Use of the Device:

LightSheer® Pulsed Diode Array Laser Systems are indicated for use in surgical,
aesthetic, and cosmetic applications in the medical specialties of general and plastic
surgery, and dermatology. The LightSheer® Pulsed Diode Array Laser Systems are
intended for use on all skin types (Fitzpatrick skin types I - VI), including tanned skin.
LightSheer® Duet™ Laser Systems with LightSheer® ET™ Laser Handpiece is intended
for the treatment of vascular lesions, including angiomas, hemangiomas, telangiectasia
and other benign vascular lesions, and the treatment for pseudofolliculitis barbae. The
LightSheer® Duet™ Laser System with LightSheer® ET™ Laser Handpiece is also
intended for hair removal, permanent hair reduction, and the treatment of benign
pigmented lesions and leg veins.

LightSheer® Duet™ Laser Systems with LightSheer® HS™ Laser Handpiece is

intended for the treatment of benign vascular and pigmented lesions, hair removal, and
permanent hair reduction.

Dear Ms. Hoy:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications

devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug.
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into cither class IJ (Special Controls) or class III (PMA). it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition. FDA may
