V. Statement of Intended Use
The Cutera Er:YSGG Laser System is designed for use in applications requiring the
excision, incision, ablation, vaporization and coagulation of soft tissue. For
Dermatology and Plastic Surgery, indications include: treatment of wrinkles and skin
resurfacing. For Opthalmology, indications include: Incision, excision, vaporization
and coagulation of tissue surrounding the eye and orbit.
VI. Rationale for Substantial Equivalence
The Cutera Er:YSGG Handpiece shares the same general indications for use as the
currently marketed predicate devices, and does not raise any issues with safety and
effectiveness. There are no unique applications, indication, materials or specification
presented in this application. The Cutera Er:YSGG Handpiece is therefore
substantially equivalent to the currently marketed predicate devices.
VII. Safety and Effectiveness Information
Technologically, the Cutera Er:YSGG Handpiece is substantially equivalent to the
listed predicate devices. Therefore the risks and benefits for the Cutera Er:YSGG
Handpiece are comparable to the predicate devices.
Cutera therefore believes that there are no new questions of safety or effectiveness
raised by the introduction of this device.
VIII. Conclusion
The Cutera Er:YSGG Handpiece was found to be substantially equivalent to currently
marketed devices. The Cutera Er:YSGG shares similar indications for use, design
features, and similar functional features as the currently marketed predicate devices.

Dear Ms. Hoy:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class HI (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
