Proprietary name: Clinicon Universal WaveGuide Handpiece and Fiber Tips
Common name: CO, Laser Powered Surgical Instrument
Classification: 878.4810
Product Code: GEX
Classification name: Laser surgical instrument for use in general and plastic surgery and
in dermatology.
Substantial equivalence claimed to:
K903079, Luxar’s Endoguide ®, Microguide ™, Flexiguide™
K992472, Clinicon’s SureGuide CO2 Laser Beam Delivery System
Description:
The Universal WaveGuide Handpiece comes in two designs, one that accepts 1.5 mm
O.D. size fiber tips and one that accepts 2.5 mm O.D. size fiber tips. The 1.5 mm
handpiece is used with the Free Beam and Flexible fiber tips. The 2.5 mm handpiece is
used with the rigid fiber tips.
The collet component determines the O.D. size fibers that can be inserted into the
handpiece. The nozzle and tip lock collet secures the fiber and prevents twisting of the
fiber tip. The hand piece is attached to the Clinicon WaveGuide Platform by the FSMA
connector at the distal end of the waveguide.
The Fiber Tips are made of the same proprietary waveguide fiber as the Clinicon
WaveGuide Platform, described in the premarket notification, K992472, SUREGUIDE
CO2 Laser Beam Delivery System.

The waveguide fiber is inserted into a straight or curved stainless steel sheath for the 2.5
mm O.D. rigid fiber tips or into a Teflon tube for the 1.5 mm O.D. flexible fiber tips.
The fiber tips, both rigid and flexible are of various lengths for use in various surgical
procedures. The rigid fiber tips are also of various degrees of curvature and certain tips
may have a contact probe tip cover made of Teflon.
The fiber tips are disposable, single-use devices, and both the rigid and flexible fiber tips
have a section of colored polyethylene at the distal end of the fiber cable that acts as a
depth gauge to assure the fiber is completely seated in the handpiece. The colored
polyethylene also acts as a sterilizer indicator that will render the tips unusable if they are
re-sterilized by distorting the polyethylene and preventing the fiber from being inserted
into the handpiece.
Intended use:
The Clinicon Universal WaveGuide Handpiece and Fiber Tips are intended to be used to
deliver carbon dioxide laser energy for the incision, excision, vaporization, ablation,
coagulation or cauterization of soft tissue.
Summary of technological characteristics:
The Clinicon Universal WaveGuide Handpieces have the same technological
characteristics as the Luxar handpieces used with Luxar medical fiber tips. The Clinicon
Fiber Tips have the same technological characteristics as the Clinicon Sureguide CO2
Laser Beam Delivery System, now marketed as the Clinicon Waveguide Platform.
