Accessories (Components)
Connecting Cables- The Power Cord/Main Cable’s function is to connect the
ESU/system to the facilities’ main power. The Monopolar Connecting Cable
and the Return Electrode Connecting Cable are supplied to connect the ESU
with the instruments and return electrodes (also referred to as patient
plates/pads) utilized during the operative procedure. If the medical center has
associated equipment (e.g., the VIO Cart), the Grounding Cable(s) link(s) the
units together so that they all have a common ground.
Adapters- The Universal (Bovie-Jack) [also referred to as Monopolar] and
Bipolar Adapters are for connecting universal/monopolar or bipolar
instruments (via their cables) to the receptacles of the ESU. These Adapters
provide the user the ability to utilize most of the instruments marketed for
electrosurgical operative procedures.
Footswitches- A Footswitch provides the physician a means to activate a
mode of the ESU by depressing a foot pedal. There is a choice of three
different types of Footswitches available; the .
VIO One (Single) Pedal Coag Footswitch (Note: Activates coagulation
modes. ), :
VIO Two (Dual/Double) Pedal Footswitch (Note: Activates respectively cut
and coagulation modes.), and
VIO Two (Dual/Double) Pedal Footswitch with ReMode (Note: Activates
respectively cut and coagulation modes. It also has a “ReMode” feature
that allows the physician to switch between two pre-programmed modes
by using the button on the Footswitch rather than manually changing the
modes by hand via the display of the ESU.).
Cart- The VIO Cart is the system carrier for the ESU and associated
equipment. It has four (4) wheels, an internal storage area [Note: Primarily
used for storing/nousing argon gas cylinder(s)/regulator(s) if a compatible
ERBE APC is a part of the system.], and electrical supply for power
connections. It has a handle and a space for optional storage baskets or
attaching other associated equipment.
All of the components are supplied non-sterile and reusable.
Intended Use:
The ERBE VIO ESU with Accessories is intended to deliver high frequency electrical
current for the cutting and/or coagulation of tissue.

Similarities and Differences of the Modified Device to the Current Device (Predicate
Comparison/Substantial Equivalence):
Unit (Model VIO 300 D)
Similarities
The modified ESU (ERBE Model VIO 300 D) has the same intended use and
protective circuits as the predicate ESU (ERBE ERBOTOM Model ICC 350) with
most of the same performance specifications. Both units have user interface
displays to select modes, power settings, etc. The modified and predicate devices
are programmable and have Auto Start and Auto Stop functions. Also, each unit has
audio and visual error monitoring. The modified and predicate devices both can be
used with compatible APCs with the respective APC being controlled through the
ESU. However, the actual software for the APC is within the modified ESU which is
different than the predicate unit. The modified ESU is also manufactured by ERBE
Elektromedizin GmbH in Germany and will be supplied as a non-sterile, reusable
unit. The packaging and labeling (e.g., User Manual, etc.) components are similar
except in the descriptions of the specific user instructions. The similarities and
variations of the monopolar and bipolar modes are as follows.
Monopolar Modes:
The modified ESU has two (2) cut modes that are the same as the predicate . /
ESU. They are the “Auto Cut” and the “High Cut” modes. However, the modified
ESU has a larger voltage spread with eight (8) effect levels divided within the
range where the predicate ESU only offers four (4) effect levels.
Both the modified and predicate ESUs have the same three (3) coagulation
(coag) modes. The modes are “Soft Coag’, “Forced Coag”, and “Spray Coag”.
As with the cut modes, the modified ESU has a larger voltage spread with
multiple effect levels divided within the spread [eight (8) for “Soft Coag”, four (4)
for “Forced Coag”, and two (2) for “Spray Coag’]; whereas, the predicate ESU
only offers one (1) effect level for each made.
Bipolar Modes:
The modified and predicate ESUs have the same “Bipolar Cut” mode. But, a
larger spread in voltage and more effect levels were included in the modified
ESU. There are eight (8) effect levels in the modified unit in comparison to one
(1) for the predicate ESU.
The same “Bipolar Soft Coag” mode is in the modified as well as the predicate
device. However, the modified ESU has a larger voltage spread with eight (8)
effect levels divided within the voltage spread; whereas, the predicate ESU only
offers one (1) effect level over a smaller voltage range.
In conclusion, the larger voltage spread and more effect levels in the various
modes were included with the modified ESU per request and feedback from
doctors. The modifications were made to assist the user in obtaining the desired
tissue effect for treating various patient conditions in a variety of interventional
procedures. Nonetheless, the User Manual remains the same in the statement
to the physician: “The power output setting should be set as low as possible for
the desired tissue affect. The purpose of this is to help reduce the potential for
capacitive coupling and inadvertent burning at higher wattages/voltages.”

510K SUMMARY
Differences
The modified ESU has a display monitor that features an on-screen tutorial, pictorial
graphics illustrating modes and settings, as well as user information that defines the
modes. The monitor also visually displays errors and defines error codes. These
features aid medical personnel in the proper use of the unit and are not apart of the
predicate device. Also, when the unit is activated, the actual power delivered (in
watts) to tissue is displayed on the screen. The displayed value allows the user to
evaluate the need to increase or decrease the wattage to obtain the desired tissue
effect. Again, the predicate ESU does not display the actual power being delivered
to tissue. Furthermore, the modules for the modified ESU are interchangeable;
whereas, the predicate device has standard configured receptacies. This allows the
user to have the exact features/functions (modes) that they need. Finally, the
differences of the monopolar and bipolar modes are as follows.
Monopolar Modes:
The modified ESU in comparison to the predicate device has two (2) more cut
"modes; “Dry Cut” and “Precise Cut’, but does not have the “Endo Cut” mode.
“Precise Cut” is an optional mode. The “Dry Cut’ mode has a larger voltage
spread than prior cut modes. The properties of “Dry Cut” involve obtaining intense
hemostasis with a somewhat slower cutting speed. For example, the properties of
the mode are well suited for cutting through scar tissue. There are eight (8) effect
levels in the “Dry Cut” mode. Very fine adjustments with a high-precision power
output in a range from 1 to 50 watts are properties of the “Precise Cut” mode. The
properties of this mode minimize the necrosis at the cut edge. There are eight (8)
effect levels in the “Precise Cut” mode. At this time, the “Endo Cut” mode is in the
predicate ESU and not in the modified device. With “Endo Cut” incisions are
software controlled in such a way that short cuts are alternated with soft
coagulation in the mode. Both of the properties are in separate modes of the
modified ESU.
The modified ESU has two (2) more additional coagulation (coag) modes than the
predicate ESU. They are the “Swift Coag” and “Precise Coag” modes. The
“Precise Coag” mode is optional. The “Swift Coag” mode has a larger power
spread than prior coagulation modes because the properties of “Swift Coag’
involve obtaining a fast, effective coagulation, which is very suitable for dissection
with high hemostasis, due to its limited tissue-cutting property. There are four (4)
effect levels in the “Swift Coag Cut” mode. The “Precise Coag’ properties involve
having a very fine adjustment as well as high-precision power output in a range
from 1 to 50 watts. There are eight (8) effect levels for the “Precise Coag” mode.
Bipolar Modes:
The modified ESU has one (1) additional standard bipolar coagulation (coag)
mode, “Bipolar Forced Coag”. This mode has a larger voltage spread than in prior
coagulation modes to achieve faster bipolar coagulation.
The modified ESU has one other available bipolar coagulation mode, “BiClamp”.
The optional mode when used with a bipolar clamp affects a larger surface area
than with the other bipolar modes. There are four (4) increasing effect levels.
Adjustments can be made in relationship to the coagulation performance and the
type of tissue that is involved.

510K SUMMARY

The additional modes in the modified ESU were included to meet the needs of

physicians in obtaining desired tissue effects in a variety of interventional

procedures and treatment of various patient conditions. Again, the statement to

the physician in the User Manual is: “The power output setting should be set as low

as possible for the desired tissue affect. The purpose of this is to help reduce the

potential for capacitive coupling and inadvertent burning at higher

wattages/voltages.”

All the unit modifications have been verified or validated in design control.

Accessories (Components)

Connecting Cabies

Similarities

The Main Cable/Power Cord, Monopolar Connecting Cable, and Return Electrode

Connecting Cable are the same for the modified and predicate ESU.

Differences

The Grounding Cable for the modified ESU is slightly smaller and shorter in length

(approximately 11” versus 19-1/2”) in comparison to the predicate ESU. However,
_ both Cables fit both systems and can be used interchangeably. The intended use

and performance specifications are the same.

Adapters

Similarities

The Universal (Bovie-Jack) [Monopolar] Adapter is the same for the modified and

predicate ESU.

Differences

The modified and predicate devices have the same Bipolar Adapter. However, the

body of the Adapter was slightly changed so that it fits into the bipolar receptacle of

both units.

Footswitches

Similarities

The Footswitches for the modified ESU are comparable to the predicate

Footswitches in that they have the same intended use and performance

specifications (except for the difference in the “ReMode’” Footswitch described

below), safety requirements (AP and IP X8 Equipment), packaging, and labeling.

Also all of the Footswitches are provided non-sterile and are reusable.

Differences

The VIO Two (Dual/Double) Pedal Footswitch with ReMode has a “ReMode”

button feature that allows a physician to use his foot to change between selected

modes during a procedure.

Cart
Similarities
The VIO Cart for the modified ESU in comparison to the Cart for the predicate ESU
are the same in that they both house/carry their respective ESU and are used to
store components and instruments. Both have handles. Dimensionally the Carts
are very similar. Also, both are supplied non-sterile and reusable.
Differences
The modified VIO Cart has a larger wheelbase in comparison to the predicate.
This gives added balance and stability when wheeling the cart over thresholds and
elevator openings. The predicate Cart has shelves and a drawer; where as, the
modified Cart has a storage cabinet and space for baskets. Also, the modified VIO
Cart has electrical outlets and connection. This modification provides user with the
means to centrally connect and ground all associated equipment.
All the modifications of the components have been verified or validated in design
control.
Conclusion:
The ERBE VIO ESU (Model VIO 300 D) with Accessories has the same intended use,
principles of operation, and technological characteristics as the predicate ESU in the
previously cleared 510(k).
The modifications in the ESU involve having a more user friendly platform (e.g., adding
a tutorial, providing setting/operational and error code information as well as displaying
the actual power delivered to tissue on the monitor, etc.) and distinguishing further
modes as well as having more defined effect levels in larger voltage ranges to assist the
physician in interventional procedures to achieve desired tissue effect. Also, com- .
ponent changes involve meeting user needs (e.g., having ReMode on a Footswitch,
electrical outlets on the Cart, etc.).
In conclusion, all the changes were verified or validated. As a result, the changes did
not raise safety or efficacy concerns nor adversely affect safety or effectiveness.
