Device Description
The Candela Family of Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser (Alex; 4za) systems consists of an
Alexandrite laser head, a Q-switching mechanism, a power supply and a deionized water
circulator. The laser head contains the cavity mirrors, pockels cell, solid state laser
medium (the Alexandrite rod), and two high intensity xenon flashlamps which excite the
laser medium. A calibration port with an internal meter is located on the control panel,
which is used to verify the transmission of the optical fiber and handpiece, and to
calibrate the output of the handpiece at selected fluence levels. The temperature of the
laser head is regulated by the circulation of distilled water at a controlled temperature.
The Candela Family of Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser (Alexzazz) systems is fully air cooled.
1"

The Candela Family of Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser (Alex:azr) systems delivers laser energy at
a wavelength of 755 nm with a nominal pulse width of 50 nanoseconds. The output of this laser
is delivered to the area of treatment by means of a lens coupled user replaceable optical fiber
with a treatment handpiece attached to its distal end. A trigger switch is used to control the
delivery of pulses.
A microprocessor based system controller is used to monitor and direct all system
functions. Users of the laser select parameters such as desired energy density (fluence)
level and repetition rate and monitor operation via electronic controls and a display panel.
The control panel is also used to enable or disable the triggering of the laser, to initiate
the calibration feature and to obtain feedback from the system, such as the number of
pulses delivered or spot size selected. The Candela Family of Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser
(Alex_aze) systems supports 2mm, 3mm, and 4mm nominal spot sizes.
Description of Intended Use
The Candela Family of Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser (Alex,azr) systems is indicated for
treatment in the following uses:

/ Pigmented Lesions
Tattoos
Rationale for Substantial Equivalence
The Candela Family of Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser (Alex,azpr) systems, has the same intended
use, utilizes similar functional features (including power output, spot size, repetition rate, energy,
and fluence) and matches key design aspects (including wavelength, light generation medium,
power supply, cooling and controls system) , as the predicate devices.

” The Candela Family of Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser (Alex.azr) systems shares similar methods
of assembly, method of operation, and intended uses, and therefore is substantially equivalent to
the currently legally marketed Candela Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser, (Alexi azr), K955662,
Candela Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser (Alex:4zp), K95083 predicate devices.

Safety and Effectiveness Information
The Candela Family of Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser (Alex,azr) systems is substantial
equivalent to the currently legally marketed Candela Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser, (Alex:azr),
K955662, Candela Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser (Alex:4zr), K950831 predicate devices in
intended use and technological features and therefore the risks and benefits are comparable
to the predicate devices.
We therefore believe that there are no new questions of safety or effectiveness raised by the
introduction of the Candela Family of Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser (Alex,azr) systems
Conclusion
Base on the similarities in indications for use, design features, and functional features the
Candela Family of Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser (Alex_azr) systems has been shown to be
substantially equivalent to the current legally marketed predicate devices.

Trade/Device Name: Candela Family of Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser (Alexiazp) systems

Regulation Number: 21 CFR 878.4810

Regulation Name: Laser surgical instrument for use in general and plastic surgery

and in dermatology

Regulatory Class: II

Product Code: GEX

Dated: October 5, 2006

Received: October 10, 2006
Dear Mr. Roberts:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class I (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
“Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
