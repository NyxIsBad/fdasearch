2. Names
Device Name: LumaProbe Model # 7002-01 with hand probes (Models: 7201-415,
7204-631, and 7205-830
Classification Name: Laser instrument, surgical, powered device; GEX, ILY
FDA Class II category
Although this device is not a laser, the specifications developer feels
this is the closest applicable classification name.
3. Predicate Device
LumaProbe is substantially equivalent to the Omnilux Blue (K030883), Omnilux Revive (K030426),
Omnilox Plus (K043317)
4. Device Description
The LumaProbe is a device that utilizes Light Emitting Diodes to provide LED light to the body. The LumaProbe
Red, IR and Blue are a visible light source of high spectral purity. They provide uniform or “hot-spot” free
illumination. The output is pre-tuned to one wavelength with a narrow spectral bandwidth, The output wavelength
of Red is 631 +/- 4nm, IR is 830 +/- nm and Blue is 415 +/- 5nm. The LumaProbe unit contains the power
supplies and the control unit; it has the capabilities to power and sequence up to 2 attachable probes depending on
the product model, that deliver the light to the skin as they are moved over the skin surface. The STOP button
directly on the probes allows the user to immediately remove all power to the probes.
5. Indications for Use:
LumaProbe (Red-631) is generally indicated for the treatment of superficial, benign vascular and pigmented
lesions
LumaProbe (Blue-415) is generally indicated for the treatment of dermatological conditions and specially
indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate inflammatory acne vulgaris.
LumaProbe ({R-830) is generally indicated for the temporary relief of minor muscle and joint pain, arthritis and
: muscle spasm, relieving stiffness; promoting the relaxation of muscle tissue; and to temporarily increase local
blood circulation where applied.

6. Comparison of Technological Differences:
The intended use and technological characteristics of the LumaProbe system are virtually identical to the intended
use and technological characteristics of the listed equivalent devices. Any differences between the LumaProbe and
the equivalent devices have no significant influence on safety or effectiveness of the LumaProbe product.

7. Conclusions
Based upon an analysis of the overall performance characteristics for the LumaProbe, Clareblend, Inc. believes
that no significant differences exist between this system and the predicate systems quoted, therefore, the
LumaProbe Light Therapy device does not impose any new safety or effectiveness concerns,

Dear Ms. Creasy:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
. product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474, For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance
