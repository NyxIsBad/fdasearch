8. Device Description:
Background. The Seartite 2065 is an “after-market" accessory for use with an existing surgical laser
system. The device is used as a complete system (optical fiber and connector) The SearLite 2006 iS
used as a direct replacement for the laser optical fiber supplied as original equipment or the original
equipment laser optical fiber.
One of the primary considerations when using a fiber-optically delivered surgical laser system is that
the fiber is capable of delivering the maximum amount of energy the laser is set for minus a smali
connector loss.
Most fiber based laser systems include a handpiece that clasps or grips the laser fiber on its
protective jacket. For this reason the laser fiber must have an outside coating capable of protecting
the inner core.
Many procedures call for the use or application of a "bare fiber" to the operative tissue; the so called
“contact mode" of operation.
The starLice is designed using industry standard connectors and optical fiber. The components of this
fiber optic assembly are the same as what is currently being used on cleared existing lasers cited
above. The protective outside buffer or jacket is compatible with all handpieces designed for this fiver
type.
The starLice laser fiber optic is intended for use with lasers that do various surgical procedures. The
StarLite is universal in nature and is intended to be used on currently FDA cleared soft tissue lasers.
The StarLite assembly is designed to accommodate hard clad jaser fibers including 200, 300, 400
and 600 micron diameters.
9. Cleared Indications for use:
The StarLite is cleared for the same cieared indications of use as the laser system to which it is
attached.

Dear Mr. Feinberg:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA),
it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device
can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA
may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 — Mr. Feinberg
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your
device to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
