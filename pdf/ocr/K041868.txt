Predicate Device: Disposable Electrosurgical Pencils
510(k) # K936304
Device Description: This pencil has applications in general surgical procedures to provide a means
of cutting and coagulation using electrosurgical current. The device consists of a cable for
connection to the output of an electrosurgical generator unit, to carry high-frequency (HF)
electrosurgical current to an electrode tip at the distal end of the handpiece. The handpiece is
provided with various electrode types and cable lengths and acts as a hand-switching conduit in
delivering the HF energy from the electrosurgical generator unit through an electrode to produce the
therapeutic affect. Current is activated by the cut/coagulation switching element buttons on the
handpiece. The devices will be distributed sterile for single-use applications.
Intended Use of Device: Single-use hand-switching electrosurgical accessory handpiece used in
conjunction with an electrosurgical generator for delivery of RF electrosurgical current through an
electrode for cutting and coagulation at the operative site.
Technological Characteristics: The proposed device is equivalent to the identified predicate device
with respect to technological characteristics and function. The device has been designed to comply
with the applicable sections of ANSI/AAMI American National Standard for Electrosurgical Devices
HF-18, the International Electrotechnical Commission Standard for Electrosurgical Devices, IEC
60601-2-2, Sterilization of health care products — Requirements for validation and routine control —
Radiation Sterilization, ISO 11137 and Biocompatibility, ISO 10993.

Dear Ms. Vetter:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 - Ms. Pamela Vetter
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
