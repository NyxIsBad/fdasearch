Device Description
The Wave Form Manufacturing Prolase General Shaped (PGS) Fiber is a fiber optic
laser delivery system consisting of a 3 meter long silica fiber, clad in fluorinated
doped silica, buffered with a fluorinated acrylate and a shaped tip. As an integral
part of a laser system, the PGS fiber may be used for a wide variety of surgical
procedures.
Indications for Use
The Wave Form Manufacturing Prolase General Shaped Fiber is intended to be used
for vaporization, cutting, ablation and coagulation of soft tissue in conjunction with or
without endoscopic equipment including laparoscopes, hysteroscopes, ureteroscopes,
bronchoscopes, cystoscopes, gastroscopes, arthroscopes, colonoscopes, or for open
surgery in contact or non-contact surgery with or without handpieces for use in
coagulation, incision/excision, ablation and vaporization of soft tissue.
The Wave Form Manufacturing PGS Fiber is indicated for use in medicine and
surgery in the following specialties: Urology, Pulmonology, Arthroscopy, Podiatry,
Orthopedics, Lithotripsy, ENT Surgery, Neurosurgery, Gastroenterology, Plastic
Surgery, Dermatology, Radiology, Gynecology, and General and Vascular Surgery.

Technological Characteristics and Performance Data

Design changes made to the Wave Form Manufacturing PGS Fiber are the addition of
an internal proprietary quartz sleeve reflector which protects the laser focusing lens
from back splatter of vaporized metal from the connector ferrule and the addition of
an optical secondary memory cladding to help guide a steerable endoscope with the
optical fiber.

Bench testing was performed to demonstrate that the device will perform as intended.

Dear Mr. Brown: |
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register. .
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CER Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 — Mr. Joe Brown . :
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)

- premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801 and
additionally 21 CFR Part 809.10 for in vitro diagnostic devices), please contact the Office of
Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Additionally, for questions on the promotion and advertising of
