Trade Name: Skintact® Cool Contact Electrosurgical Grounding Plates
Common Name: Electrosurgical Grounding Plates
Classification Name: Electrosurgical Grounding Plates
SUBSTANTIALLY EQUIVALENT TO: Skintact® Cool Contact Electrosurgical Grounding Plates are
equivalent to the materials of construction and gel used in the ERBE Disposable Patient Return Electrode
cleared via 510(k) [K972269] and produced by Leonhard Lang, GmbH. However the Skintact®
Electrosurgical Grounding Plates have a different geometry and area. This area and geometry is
equivalent to that found with Nikopad Electrosurgical grounding plates, previously cleared by FDA
{K993306.) Based upon these similar features and conformance with the recognized standard ANSV/AAMI
HF 18:2001, the Leonhard Lang Skintact® Electrosurgical Grounding Plates are substantially equivalent.
DESCRIPTION of the DEVICE: Skintact® Cool Contact Electrosurgical Grounding Plates (and as
also to be offered for sale under various private label tradenames) are self-adhesive, non-sterile, single use
disposable electrodes, available in a comprehensive range of shapes and sizes (adult and pediatric),
standard and split, with or without lead wires.
INDICATIONS FOR USE: Skintact® Cool Contact Electrosurgical Grounding Plates are designed for
use with electrosurgical generators for cutting and coagulation of human tissue.
SUMMARY of TESTING: Biocompatibility testing confirms the materials are biocompatible and do
not introduce any risks. The following testing showed no adverse results: Cytotoxicity; Skin Imitation;
Sensitization... The ANSI/AAMI HF 18:2001 “Electrosurgical devices” was used to define the
requirements for Skintact® Cool Contact Electrosurgical Grounding Plates. All performance and safety tests
are according to ANSI/AAMI HF 18:2001 and were conducted by TUV Product Service GmbH,
Zertifizierstelle,RidlerstraBe 65, 80339 Miinchen, Germany. A certification to conformance ANSI/AAMI
HF 18:2001 with this standard has been provided. The testing conducted was: Maximum safe temperature
rise; Electrode contact impedance; Electrode adherence: Pull test, Conformability test, Fluid tolerance test.
All Skintact® Grounding Plates are packaged in water-vapor-proofed, heat-sealed, non-transparent,
aluminized pouches. Leonhard Lang has 20 years of experience with this packaging and has met
requirements for 24 months shelf-life. No differences were required for packaging the Skintact® Coc!
