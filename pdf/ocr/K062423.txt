Description:
The OmniGuide Beam Delivery System is an accessory for CO, laser systems. It consists
of an adapter and a fiber assembly that propagate CO. laser beams. The OmniGuide .
Beam Delivery System Beampath 100 Handpeice Fiber is supplied sterile and is
intended for single procedure use. The Beam Delivery System Adapter is provided non
sterile for multiple uses. The Adapter will be configured to attach to specific CO) laser
configurations
Intended Use:
The OmniGuide Beam Delivery System is intended for the incision, excision, ablation,
vaporization and coagulation of body soft tissues including intraoral tissues.
Summary of Technological Characteristics:
The device contains the optical fiber assembly and the adapter for connecting the fiber to
the laser. The main functional component of the fiber assembly is a photonic bandgap
reflector lining its hollow core that reflects and thereby guides CO, laser energy. The
fiber assembly is 1.0 m or 2.0 m long and transmits at the CO> laser emission wavelength
of 10.6 fim.
The adapter links the fiber assembly and the CO} laser.
Performance Data:
Non-clinical Performance Data: The OmniGuide Beam Delivery System performance
characteristics have been evaluated through testing and analysis of laser power output and
beam quality. This type of testing complies with the respective section of the FDA
Guidance on the Content and Organization of a Premarket Notification for a Medical
Laser (1995) and is similar to the predicate device tests. The performance of the
OmniGuide Beam Delivery System and related parameters of predicate devices (as
specified in comparison table) are comparable.
Clinical Performance Data: Formal clinical trials were not deemed necessary as the
device is using the same technology and intended use as predicate devices.
Conclusions Drawn from Tests and Analysis: The intended use and major performance
parameters (energy transmission levels and beam quality) of the OmniGuide Beam
Delivery System are similar or equivalent to same characteristics of above mentioned
legally marketed devices.
