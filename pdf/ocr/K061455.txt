The Dornier Medilas H 20 Laser is a pulsed solid-state Holmium:YAG laser system. The
Dornier Medilas H 20 Laser emits laser radiation in the invisible wavelength range of 2080
nm in either a continuous-wave or pulsed mode, which is absorbed primarily by water, with
an average penetration depth of approximately 400m (0.4mm). The Dornier Medilas H 20
Laser incorporates a graphic display panel with touch screen capabilities allowing the
operator to control the functions and laser parameters of the laser. The laser pulse control
panel regulates the pulse energy, pulse frequency, pulse mode (continuous mode, pedalcontrolled repetitive burst mode and control panel bursts mode), pilot brightness, and various
Menu functions. The Dornier Medilas H 20 Laser light emission is transmitted to the
application site by a sterile fiber optic delivery systems or fiber optic cables with a SMA 905
connector.
5. Intended Use
The Dornier Medilas H 20 Laser is designed for use in conjunction with various fiber
optic cables as a laser system. The modified Dornier Medilas H 20 Laser and
currently marketed Dornier Medilas H Laser are intended to be used for cutting,
vaporization, ablation, and coagulation of soft tissue in conjunction with endoscopic
equipment (including laparoscopes, hysteroscopes, bronchoscopes, gastroscopes,
cystoscopes, and colonoscopes), or for open surgery for contact or non-contact
surgery with or without a handpiece for use in incision/excision, vaporization,
ablation and coagulation of soft tissue. The Dornier Medilas H 20 Laser is indicated :
for use in medicine and surgery, in the following medical specialties:
« Arthroscopy
« Urology
« —_Lithotripsy
e Pulmonology
e Gastroenterology
« Gynecology
e ENT
* General Surgery
6. Technological Characteristics
The proposed Dornier Medilas H 20 Laser is substantially equivalent to the predicate devices
Trimedyne OmniPulse Mini, Model 2120 Holmium:YAG Laser System (K043012) and
Lumenis VersaPulse PowerSuite Holmium Surgical Laser and Delivery Devices with
Accessories (K011703) in device design, technology characteristics, and operational
characteristics as provided in the Premarket Notification. Some of the Technology
characteristics described include:
Principles of Operation: The Dornier Medilas H 20 Laser and all predicate lasers have
same basic operational features for Holmium YAG lasers with flash lamp emission.
Laser Type: The Dornier Medilas H 20 Laser and all predicate lasers are Solid State
Holmium HO:YAG lasers which are equivalent.

Maximum Radiant Power: The Dornier Medilas H 20 Laser and all predicate lasers have a
maximum of 20 Watts radiant power wattage which are equivalent.
Wavelength: The Dornier Medilas H 20 Laser has a wavelength of 2080nm and all
predicate lasers operate at 2100nm which are equivalent.
Energy Output: The Dornier Medilas H 20 Laser and all predicate lasers have energy
outputs between 1.8J to 2.5J which are equivalent.
Pulse Duration: The Dornier Medilas H 20 Laser has a pulse duration of 350us and all
predicate lasers have pulse durations between 250us — 500us which are equivalent.
Cooling Method: The Dornier Medilas H 20 Laser has an integrated water cooling system
with water/air exchangers and all predicate lasers have integrated water cooling system with
water/air exchangers which are equivalent.
Operational Modes: The Dornier Medilas H 20 Laser and all predicate lasers have
continuous and pulse modes which are equivalent.
Delivery Systems: The Dornier Medilas H 20 Laser and all predicate lasers use equivalent
ethylene oxide sterilized fiber optic delivery systems with a SMA 905 connector that are used
in conjunction with endoscopes for target visualization.

7. Rational for Substantial Equivalence
The Dornier Medilas H 20 Laser has the same indications for uses as the predicate device
Dornier Medilas H Laser (K981718). The Dornier Medilas H 20 Laser has the same general
indications for uses as the predicate devices Trimedyne OmniPulse Mini, Model 2120
Holmium:YAG Laser System (K043012) and Lumenis VersaPulse PowerSuite Holmium
Surgical Laser and Delivery Devices with Accessories (K011703). There is no safety of
efficacy concerns with the indications for use statements as presented.

8. Safety and Effectiveness Information
Safety and effectiveness information was provided in the Premarket Notification to
demonstrate that the Dornier Medilas H 20 Laser is safe and effective, when indicated for
use for general and specific applications in the medical specialties of Arthroscopy, Urology,
Lithotripsy, Pulmonology, Gastroenterology, Gynecology, ENT, and General Surgery.

9. Conclusion
The Dornier Medilas H 20 Laser was determined to be substantially equivalent to similar
current marketed and predicate surgical lasers. The Dornier Medilas H 20 Laser has the
same indications for uses as the predicate device Dornier Medilas H Laser (K981718). The
Dornier Medilas H 20 Laser has the same general indications for uses as the predicate
devices Trimedyne OmniPulse Mini, Model 2120 Holmium:YAG Laser System (K043012)
and Lumenis VersaPulse PowerSuite Holmium Surgical Laser and Delivery Devices with
Accessories (K011703).

Dear Mr. Thomas:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug.
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class IJ (Special Controls) or class HI (PMA). it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements. including. but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807): labeling (21 CFR Part 801): good manufacturing practice requirements as set

Page 2 — Mr. Tim Thomas
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
