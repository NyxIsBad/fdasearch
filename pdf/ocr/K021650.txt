delivered to the Athos handpieces, the Athoscan, or the Constans Cooling
System through fiber optics. The Athoscan increases the efficiency of
treating large areas of skin (during hair removal) and the Constans Cooling
System reduces reduce pain and the risk of thermal damage by cooling the
skin during laser treatment.
Indications: The indications for use cleared in KO20072 for General Surgery for the
Athos laser are modified as follow:
General Surgery: Soft tissue in general surgery applications, skin incisions,
tissue dissection, excision of external tumors and lesions, complete or partial
resection of internal organs, tumors, lesions, tissue ablation, vessel
coagulation, and treatment of leg veins.
The Athoscan and Constans Cooling System are indicated for use with the
Athos laser for indications for which the laser has been cleared.
The Athoscan and Constans Cooling System are also labeled: “CAUTION:
Federal law restricts the sale to or use by licensed professionals.”
Performance Data: None required.
