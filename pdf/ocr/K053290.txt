2. Name of Device
Trade or Proprietary Name Cooi-tip™ RF System
Common/Classification Name. Electrosurgical Cutting and Coagulation Device
and Accessories
3. Predicate Devices
The Cool-tio™ RF System of this submission is substantially equivalent to the Cool-tio™
RF System covered by 510(k} notification KO42216 dated 11/12/04.
4, Device Description
The Cocl-tip™ RF System consists of a microprocessor based RF generator, a
peristaltic pump, electrodes. inflow and outflow tubing for electrode cooling. and return
pads. The generator pump and electrodes are designed to produce local tissue heating
at the tip of the electrodes causing the coagulation (ablation) of the tissue.
The Cool-tip"* RF System generator is capabie of delivering up to 200 watts {into a $0
Ohm resistive load) while monitoring tissue impedance and electrode tip temperature
during the delivery of the RF energy. The generator includes manual and impedance
control ana displays/monitors impedance. current. power and temperature.
The Cool-tip"* RF System electrodes are available in either a single electrode or a
cluster electrode configuration. The electrodes are moncpolar devices. The cluster
electrode is three electrode shafts combined into one handle in 2 triangular patter with
approximately 0.5 cm separation. The electrodes are provided sterile, for singie use
only. The shaft of the electrode is stainless steel that is insulated to various lengths
from the tip of the electrode. Embedded within the tio of each electrode is a
thermocouple for temperature measurement. Cooling of the electrode is provided by
chilied sterile water which is pumped (using the peristaitic pump) through the inflow
tubing, the electrode and out through the outflow tubing. This is an enclosed system
within the electrode and the sterlé water does not contact the patient. Because of the

monopolar nature of the electrodes. electrical current flows through the tip of the
electrode, through the target tissue and to the return pad.
5. intended Use
The Cool-tip™ RF Ablation System (Generator and accessories) is intended for use in
percutaneous, laparoscopic and intraoperative coagulation and ablation of tissue, such
as partial or complete ablation of non-resectable liver tumors.
6. Summary of Technological Characteristics
The Cool-tip’’ RF System has the same basic technological characteristics as the
predicate device noted above.
7. Performance and Clinical Data
Comparative in vivo and ex vivo product testing has shown the Cool-tip™ RF System to
be equivalent to currently marketed devices with regard to coagulation/ablation of
lesions. Independent clinical studies have shown the use of the system to be clinically
safe and effective for ablation of primary and metastatic, unresectable liver tumors.

Trade/Device Name: Cool-tip™ RF System
Regulation Number: 21 CFR 878.4400
Regulation Name: Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation device and accessories
Regulatory Class: II
Product Code: GEI
Dated: January 12, 2006
Received: January 13, 2006
Dear Mr. Copperberg:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class [II (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
“Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
(301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address http://www.fda.gov/edrh/dsma/dsmamain.html
