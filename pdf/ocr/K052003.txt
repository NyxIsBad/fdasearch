Summary of Safety and Effectiveness

VNUS RFS and RFSFlex devices “4 4,
B. Common Name
Bipolar Electrosurgical Instrument
Cc. Predicate Device(s)
VNUS® Closure® System (K982816, KO03092, and K030557); and
VNUS® Vessel and Tissue Coagulation System (proprietary name: TBD) (K033547)
D. Device Description
The VNUS RFS family of devices is a bipolar, high frequency electrosurgical system
designed for use in general surgical procedures where blood vessel and tissue
coagulation is desired. These devices are compatible with separately cleared
Radiofrequency (RF) Generator, and the Instrument Cable manufactured by VNUS
Medical Technologies.
The VNUS RFS family of devices are sterile disposable devices intended for a singleuse only. The device’s function is to deliver bipolar RF energy to the desired treatment
/ site and relay temperature and other feedback to the RF Generator. The disposable
device is available in 2 bipolar configurations and multiple lengths for selection by the
physician based on preference for method of vessel access, location and length of the
vessel to be treated. This submission reflects a name change, minor modification of the
indication statement (more specific inclusion of perforator and tributary veins), and minor
design changes.
E. Intended Use
The VNUS RFS and RFSFlex Devices are intended for use in vessel and tissue
coagulation including:
* Treatment of incompetent (i-e., refluxing) perforator and tributary veins
F. Intended Use of Predicate Devices
The specified predicate devices are indicated for “coagulation of blood vessels in
patients with superficial vein reflux” (VNUS Closure System) and “vessel and tissue
coagulation” (VNUS Vessel and Tissue Coagulation System).
G. Technological Comparison
RF energy has been widely used in electrosurgical equipment for many years. The
safety and efficacy of such devices has been well established for a variety of intended
uses. The use of bipolar RF energy delivery has potential advantages over monopolar
systems. No grounding pads are required, and the potential for damage to adjacent
tissue is minimized, as the patient is no longer the return path for electrical current. The
efficiency of bipolar RF energy delivery allows systems such as the VNUS RF Generator
to be used at lower voltage and power settings as compared with monopolar systems.

VNUS® RFS and RFSFlex Devices Jk OS QOOD (S05 fog.2 9D
The technological characteristics and principals of operation of the VNUS RFS family of
devices are substantially equivalent to the noted predicate devices. All devices rely on
the delivery of RF energy to achieve their intended use.
H. Discussion of Clinical/Non-Clinical Tests and Conclusions
Performance
Results of in-vitro testing demonstrate that the VNUS RFS and RFSFlex devices are
safe and effective for their intended function.
Biocompatibility
The materials used in the VNUS RFS and RFSFlex Devices have been shown to be
biocompatible.
I. Summary of Safety and Effectiveness
Based upon the intended use, design, materials, function, comparison with currently
marketed devices and the non-clinical testing it is concluded that the VNUS RFS and
RFSFiex Devices are substantially equivalent to the noted predicate devices. The RF
ablation/coagulation of blood vessels (i.e., VNUS Closure) has a well-established history
of safe an efficacious use in over 100,000 procedures.

Trade/Device Name: VNUS" RIS and RES Flex Devices
Regulation Number: 21 CFR 878.4400
Regulation Name: Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation device and accessories
Regulatory Class: II
Product Code: GEI
Dated: July 22, 2005
Received: July 25, 2005
Dear Mr. Nanavati:
We have reviewed your Section $10(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially cquivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug.
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approva! of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (sce above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class [If (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including. but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820): and tf applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
