Intended Use/Indication for Use
The Ceralas D 810 is intended for delivery of laser light to soft tissue in the contact
or non-contact mode during surgical procedures, including via endoscopes,
introducers, or catheters. The Ceralas D 810 is generally indicated for incision,
excision, vaporization, ablation, hemostasis or coagulation of soft tissue in ear, nose
and throat and oral surgery (otolaryngology), dental procedures, arthroscopy,
gastroenterology, general surgery, dermatology, plastic surgery, podiatry, urology,
gynecology, neurosurgery (peripheral nervous system), pulmonary surgery, and

cardiothoracic surgery. This Ceralas D 810 is specifically indicated for hemostasis
or coagulation of soft tissue (including cardiac tissue).
Performance Data
The device complies with the following voluntary consensus standards: 21 C.F.R.
§§ 1040.10 & 1040.11; ANSI/AAMI ES1; IEC 601-1; IEC 601-2-22; and EN 60825-1.
Substantial Equivalence
The Ceralas D 810 has the same intended use and the exact same technological
characteristics as the previously cleared Ceralas D 810 with the exception ofa
minor modification to the handpiece for hemostasis or coagulation of cardiac tissue.
In addition, all of the Ceralas D 810’s general and specific indications for use are
cleared indications of at least one of its predicate devices. The Ceralas D 810 also
has very similar technological characteristics as its predicate devices. Thus, the
Ceralas D 810 is substantially equivalent.

Dear Mr. Kahan:
This letter corrects our substantially equivalent letter of March 19, 2004.
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices,
good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class HI (PMA),
it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be
found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Page 2 - Mr. Jonathan Kahan
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to continue marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your
device to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0120. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
