510(k) Summary of Safety & Effectiveness, Continued
oe
Device The electrosurgical instrument is used for grasping, dissection and
Description cauterization in endoscopic general surgery. The distal instrument ScISSOrs OF
jaws are opened and closed using ring loop handles. The instrument shaft is
insulated and designed for use with an appropriately sized trocar cannula; the
shaft can be rotated 360° in either direction using a handle knob. Devices
with electrocautery capability are supplied with a pin for connection to a
compatible electrosurgical unit; use of the device for monopolar
electrocautery requires use of a patient grounding pad. Monopolar
electrocautery is possible only with instruments equipped with a cautery pin
in conjunction with a compatible electrosurgical unit and patient grounding
pad.
Vanguard receives previously used electrosurgical instruments from
healthcare facilities; cleans, inspects, tests, repackages and sterilizes the
devices; and returns them to a healthcare facility.
Ey
Technological © Vanguard reprocessed electrosurgical instruments are essentially identical to
Characteristics the currently marketed Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) devices.
Device materials, specifications, and technological characteristics are
equivalent.
a
Test Data Cleaning, sterilization, and packaging validations, and performance and
biocompatibility testing demonstrate that the reprocessed devices perform as
intended and are safe and effective.
a
Conclusion Based on the information provided herein and the 510(k) “Substantial
Equivalence” Decision Making Process Chart, we conclude that the Vanguard
reprocessed electrosurgical instruments are substantially equivalent to their
predicate devices under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.

Dear Ms. Crawford:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device

devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug.
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class If] (PMA). it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may

comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CER Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
