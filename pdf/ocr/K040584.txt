Common, Classification and Proprietary Names
Common Name: Electrosurgical electrode
Classification Name: Radio frequency cautery device (21 CFR section 886.4100)
Proprietary name: NMX-1000™
. Predicate Devices
The NeoMedix NMX-1000™ is identical to the NeoMedix Microsurgical Bipolar Handpiece (K024304; GEI and
HQR) in general indications, materials, design and features for ophthalmic surgery. The NeoMedix NMX1000™ is substantially equivalent in terms of medical intent to the Storz Goniotomy knife [510(k) exempt).
Indications for Use
The NMX-1000™ is designed to surgically remove a strip of the Trabecular meshwork for surgical
management of infantile and adult glaucoma.
Device Description
The NMX-1000™ is a sterile single use device that consists of a bipolar probe and channels for irrigation and
aspiration. These channels are connected to medical grade tubing with standard luer fittings. The device
handpiece is ABS plastic and incorporates a stainless steel probe designed to operate in the bipolar mode
when connected to a compatible electrosurgical generator capable of low energy output control. The supplied
irrigation and aspiration sets provide for connection of the handpiece to standard irrigation and aspiration
devices.

Technological Characteristics Comparison
The probe is identical in design to the currently marketed NeoMedix MicroSurgical Bipolar Handpiece in that
the application of radio frequency current is bipolar in nature and occurs at the probe tip. The irrigation and
aspiration capabilities are the same as those of the MBH and similar to that of the Storz Maumenee
Goniotomy knife cannula. The cutting capability of radio frequency electrosurgical devices is well known and
yields a similar result to that of the Goniotomy knife. The construction materials used have an established
history of safe use in similar medical devices.
Performance and Safety
The biological safety of the device has been demonstrated through biocompatibility studies of all patient
contact materials in accordance with the standards outlined in ISO 10993-1. Electrical safety has been
demonstrated by compliance to applicable requirements defined in IEC 60601-1 for leakage current and
ANSVAAMI HF-18 for handpiece dielectric voltage. Physical testing was performed to assure connector
integrity, tip bend resistance and fluidic flow capability. Comparative studies on human and animal tissue
demonstrate results equivalent to predicate devices. The device is supplied sterile and sterility will conform to
a Sterility Assurance Level (SAL) of 40° The supplied instructions for use provide the user with the applicable
warnings and cautions during use. The device is contraindicated for closed angle glaucoma. Since the device
is currently cleared for ophthalmic use and yields a result equivalent to that of a Goniotomy knife, there are no
new safety or effectiveness issues related to this device.
