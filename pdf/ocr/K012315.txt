Trade Name LeVeen™ Electrode

Common/Classification Electrosurgical Electrode

Name

Classification Class II

Summary of Substantial The modified LeVeen™ Electrode is substantially

Equivalence equivalent to the previously cleared LeVeen™ Electrode

Device Description The device consists of a preshaped, multi-armed electrode
array which is contained within a delivery cannula. The
array is attached to a handle mechanism that deploys the
array into the targeted tissue. In addition, each device is
supplied with an insulated introducer sheath/stylet
assembly to allow the physician to locate the target tissue
prior to placing and deploying the electrode. The device is
connected to a RadioTherapeutics RF generator so that RF
energy passes from the array to a patient ground pad and
heats the tissue surrounding the array.

Intended Use The LeVeen™ Electrode is intended to be used in
conjunction with a RadioTherapeutics Corporation
radiofrequency (RF) generator for the thermal coagulation
necrosis of soft tissue, including partial or complete
ablation of nonresectable liver lesions.

Dear Ms. Valley :
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications :
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
