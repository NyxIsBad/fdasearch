510(k) SUMMARY OF SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS pee GI

Device Name

Proprietary Name: Stryker Disposable Laparoscopic Scissors

Common and Usual Name: Laparoscopic Scissors

Classification Name: Electrosurgical, Cutting & Coagulation & Accessories
This 510(k) summary of safety and effectiveness is being submitted in accordance with the requirements
of the SMDA 1990.
The Stryker Disposable Laparoscopic Scissors are substantially equivalent in terms of safety and
effectiveness to currently marketed devices, including the Stryker Multi Cut Scissors (K935237).
The Stryker Disposable Laparoscopic Scissors are composed of an ABS plastic handle, 304 and 420
grade stainless steel, silicon, and medical grade PPSU (Radel). All materials are tested for
biocompatibility as any of these materials may come into contact with both the patient and surgeon. The
device is distributed sterile and intended for single use only.
The Stryker Disposable Laparoscopic Scissors are intended for cutting, dissecting and performing
monopolar electrosurgery during any laparoscopic procedure.
The Stryker Disposable Laparoscopic Scissors are tested to conform to the following voluntary safety
and performance standards: ISO 10993-1:2003 Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices, ASTM
D4169:2004 Standard Practice for Performance Testing of Shipping Containers and Systems, AAMI HF18 Electrosurgical Devices, IEC 60601-1:1988 Medical Electrical Equipment: General Requirements for
Safety, ISO7741:1986 Instruments for Surgery — Scissors and Shears: General Requirements and Test
Methods and EN 552:1994 Sterilization of Medical Devices — Validation and Routine Control of
irradiation.
There are no significant technological or performance differences between the Stryker Disposable
Laparoscopic Scissor and the identified predicate devices [Stryker Multi Cut Scissors (K935237)] nor are
there any new questions raised regarding safety or effectiveness, therefore, the Stryker Disposable
Laparoscopic Scissor is substantially equivalent to the identified predicate devices and surgery systems.

Dear Ms. Crisolo:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,

: and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of

devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II! (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
