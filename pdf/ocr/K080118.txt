SSS eens
INDICATION FOR USE:
The Zeltiq CLN1 Dermal Cooling Device is intended for use as a skin cooling device to
minimize pain and thermal injury during laser and dermatological treatments. Alternative
uses include skin cooling as a local anesthetic for procedures that induce minor local
discomfort. The Zeltiq CLN1 Dermal Cooling Device can also provide localized thermal
therapy (hot or cold) to minimize pain for post traumatic and/or post surgical pain and to
temporarily relieve minor aches and pains and muscle spasms. The optional massage
function can also be used for the temporary relief of minor muscle aches, pain, and
spasm, for temporary improvement in local circulation and temporary reduction in the
appearance of cellulite.
The Zeltiq Coupling Gels facilitate thermal contact of the Zeltiq CLNI Dermal Cooling
Device with a patient’s skin by mitigating minor variances in device-to-skin contact.
TECHNICAL CHARACTERISTICS:
The Zeltiq CLN1 Dermal Cooling Device is a thermoelectric cooling and heating device
that applies controlled cooling or heating to a treatment site. The optional massage /
feature uses electrically powered vibration or pulsatile vacuum, depending on the
applicator.

: PERFORMANCE DATA:
Testing confirms that the Zeltiq CLN1 Dermal Cooling Device can be used in an
equivalent manner to the predicate devices.
BASIS FOR DETERMINATION OF SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE:
The indications for use for the Zeltiq CLN1 Dermal Cooling Device are the same as for
the predicate devices cited in this application. A technological comparison and bench
testing demonstrate that the Zeltig CLN1 Dermal Cooling Device is functionally
equivalent to the predicate devices.

Dear Mr. Johnson:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems .
