Dear Stojan Trost:
This letter corrects our substantially equivalent letter of December 16, 2009.
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent to legally marketed
predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of
the Medical Device Amendments or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the
provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a
premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the
general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include
requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling,
and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate
information related to contract liability warranties. We remind you, however, that device
labeling must be truthful and not misleading.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA),
it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be
found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CEFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); medical device reporting (reporting of medical
device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041
or (301) 796-7100 or at its Internet address

79-GEX
DEVICE DESCRIPTION
The Fotona Fidelis ITI laser system family is based on Er: YAG (2940 nm) and Nd: YAG (1064 nm)
laser technology. It combines two flashlamp-pumped laser sources in one housing, with optical
cavities containing the Er:YAG and Nd:YAG crystals. A red diode aiming beam (650 nm) is
combined with both therapeutic laser beams. The combined therapeutic and aiming beams are
guided through an articulated arm to an optical hand piece (in the case of the Er:YAG laser), or
through an optical fiber delivery system to an optical hand piece (in the case of the Nd:YAG laser).
The Er:YAG laser is capable of delivering up to 1.5 J of laser energy in pulses with durations of up
to 1000 ps and frequencies (repetition rates) of up to 50 Hz. The maximum average output power is
20 W.
For aesthetic indications, the Nd:YAG laser is capable of delivering laser fluences up to 300 J/cm?
in pulses with durations of up to 25 ms. For dental indications, it is capable of delivering laser
pulses with durations of up to 320 us, frequencies (repetition rates) up to 100 Hz and a maximum
output power of 15 W.
Fotona's power supply Variable Square Pulse (VSP) Technology, integrated into the laser system,
allows ultimate control of the laser energy and the laser pulse duration. This ensures treatment
precision, patient comfort, safety and ease-of-use in all treatments.
INTENDED USE
The Fidelis IM Er: YAG laser, and its accessories, are intended for use in dentistry, dermatology
and other surgical areas in the following procedures:
In dentistry, for:
- Caries removal, Cavity Preparation, Enamel Roughening
-  Intra-oral soft tissue surgery (incision, excision, ablation, coagulation)

Dear Stojan Trost:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medica! Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
