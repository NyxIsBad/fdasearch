5.4 A DESCRIPTION OF THE DEVICE THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF THE 510(K), INCLUDING EXPLANATION OF
HOW THE DEVICE FUNCTIONS, BASIC SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS, SIGNIFICANT PHYSICAL AND
PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS (DESIGN, MATERIAL, PHYSICAL PROPERTIES):

The IntraLase FS Laser is a precision ophthalmic surgical laser designed for use in

performing lamellar corneal resections and incisions.

The cutting action of the IntraLase FS Laser is achieved through precise individual micro
photodisruptions of tissue, created by tightly focused ultrashort pulses which are

delivered through a disposable applanation lens while fixating the eye under very low

vacuum.

5 510(k) Summary
5.5 STATEMENT OF INTENDED USE:
The IntraLase® FS Laser is an ophthalmic surgical laser with the following indications for
use:
e In patients undergoing surgery or other treatment requiring initial lamellar
resection of the cornea;
e Inpatients undergoing surgery or other treatment requiring initial lamellar
resection of the cornea to create tunnels for placement of corneal ring segments;
e In lamellar keratoplasty and corneal harvesting;
e — Inthe creation of a corneal flap in patients undergoing LASIK surgery or other
treatment requiring initial lamellar resection of the cornea;
e Inthe creation of lamellar cut/resection of the cornea for lamellar keratoplasty
and in the creation of penetrating cut/incision for penetrating keratoplasty.
5.6 STATEMENT OF HOW THE TECHNOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DEVICE COMPARE TO
THOSE OF THE PREDICATE OF LEGALLY MARKETED DEVICE.
The technological characteristics of the IntraLase FS Laser have already been cleared
under K041893, K031960, K013941, K002890, K001211 and K993153 for lamellar
corneal resections and incisions. The changes made to the labeling do not alter the
performance or indication of this device.
5.7 BRIEF SUMMARY OF NONCLINICAL TESTS AND RESULTS:
The IntraLase FS Laser has undergone testing and is in compliance with applicable
safety standards. The IntraLase FS and the accessory IntraLase Patient Interface were
found to perform equivalently to the predicate Laser for the creation of corneal resections
with respect to incremental changes. Thus, the IntraLase FS Laser and the predicate
device have similar safety, effectiveness and performance profiles.

Dear Dr. Gauthier:
This letter corrects our substantially equivalent letter of August 16, 2006.
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices,
good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be
found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); medical device reporting (reporting of medical
device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
go to http://www. fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersO ffices/CDRH/CDRHOffices/ucm115809.htm for
the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance. Also, please
note the regulation entitled, “Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part
807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21
CFR Part 803), please go to
http://www. fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH’s Office
