Intended Use The RITA® System (RF generator and electrosurgical devices) supplies energy for

use in electrosurgery and is indicated for use in percutaneous, laparoscopic, or
intraoperative coagulation and ablation of soft tissue, including the partial or
complete ablation of non-resectable liver lesions and the palliation of pain
associated with metastatic lesions involving bone in patients who have failed or are
not candidates for standard pain therapy.

Device The RITA System consists of the following components:

Description RF Generator: Provides RF energy to the Device through the Main Cable.
Disposable Electrode (“the Device”): Consists of a number of deployable
electrodes. Some or all are equipped with a thermocouple, depending on the
model of the Device. Some Devices are used with saline infusion (“Infusion
Devices”) and require the use of a pump.

Infusion Pump: When using the RF Generator with the Infusion Devices, an offthe-shelf market-cleared infusion pump or a RITA Pump is used to deliver saline
through the Infusion Device during ablation. In the off-the-shelf pump, syringes
are connected to the Infusion Device and loaded into the Infusion Pump. In the
RITA Pump, a Tubing Kit is connected to the Infusion Device and loaded into the
RITA Pump. The RF Generator is connected to the Infusion Pump via an RS-232
cable.

Tubing Kit: The tubing kit is designed to load into the pump head from the front
of the pump. On the proximal end of the tubing-set there is a PVC Bag Spike
fitting that allows the tubing to be attached to an IV bag. The Bag Spike fitting is
attached to a single length of tubing that is connected to a splitter fitting that splits
the single tubing into 5 separate tubes. The 5 tubes are held together with clips
that allow the tubes to be uniformly loaded into the pump head. The distal end on
the tubing-set has 5 female lucrs to attach to the Infusible devices.

Main Cable: Connccts the Device to the RF Generator.

ix 24 @
Dispersive Electrode: Provides the return path for the RF energy applied by the
Device. Depending on the model, the dispersive electrode may be equipped with
thermocouples to measure skin temperature at the dispersive pad. Dispersive pads
with temperature sensing capabilities are connected to the RF Generator at the
dispersive electrode connection and at the Aux port.
Power Cord: A medical grade line cord that provides AC power to the RF
Generator.
Foot Pedal: The Foot Pedal is connected to the front of the RF Generator. The
Foot Pedal starts and stops the RF energy delivery when the RF Generator is in
“READY” mode.
Device To use the system, the RF Generator is plugged into the wall outlet via the Power
Description Cord. The electrosurgical device is connected to the RF Generator via the Main
(cont.) Cable. The Dispersive Electrode is placed on the appropriate location of the body
and is connected to its port on the RF Generator. If a pump is used, it is connected
to serial port B of the RF Generator. Once the system is successfully powered up,
the user can set the parameters of the ablation such as the mode of operation, the
ablation time, the target temperature, and the power delivery level. One mode of
operation, purge, is used to communicate with an infusion pump to prime the
system. There are four modes of operation for RF energy delivery: constant power,
constant temperature, infusion mode, and track ablation. In the infusion mode, the
RF Generator communicates with the infusion pump to set and adjust the infusion
rate. With the electrosurgical device placed in the tissue to be ablated and its
electrodes deployed, RF power can be turned on. The system parameters are
continuously monitored and displayed on the RF Generator. If the measured
parameters arc outside the acceptable limits, the RF energy delivery and fluid
delivery (if in infusion mode) automatically stops and a message appears on the
liquid crystal display (LCD). The RF energy delivery and fluid delivery (if in
infusion mode) also automatically ceases once the ablation is completed based on
the initial user-defined parameters. RF energy can also be stopped at any point by
pressing the RF on/off switch. Fluid delivery can also be stopped at any point by
pressing the pump on/off switch,
a
Performance The RITA System is subjected to design verification, software validation, ablation
Data performance, and sterilization validation testing.

Received: April 16, 2004
Dear Mr, Christensen:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
. You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class IIL (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, ‘litle 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 - Mr. Morten Christensen
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market. ° :
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
“Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
. Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or

(301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address http://www. fda. gov/cdrh/dsma/dsmamain. html
