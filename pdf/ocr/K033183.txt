Corp. ’s MedX 1000 series (K 020017), C&H international Inc.’s TDP lamp
(K020851), and Curelight’s iClear Phototherapy System (K030338).
Intended Use
The ReClear™ Phototherapy System (“ReClear™ ”) is intended to provide
phototherapcutic light to the body. The ReClear™ is specifically indicated to emit
visible blue/violet light for treatment of moderate inflammatory acne vulgaris. It
also emits infrared light energy for the temporary increase in local blood circulation,
temporary relief of minor muscle and joint aches, pains and stiffness and relaxation
of muscles; for muscle spasms, minor pain and stiffness associated with arthritis.
Technological Characteristics
The ReClear emits in the range of visible blue/violet light (405-420nm) and
infrared light (850 nm to 900 nm) with a fluency of light up to 200mW/cm?. The
system also includes an optical system for controlling spectra and beam parameters
of the light source, a mechanical fixture for holding the light source at an adjustable
distance and direction in relation to the skin treatment area, and a timer unit to
control the duration of the emitted radiation.
Substantial Equivalence
The CureLight ReClear™ is a modification to the iClear™ that has already been
cleared by FDA to provide phototherapeutic light to the body. The ReClear™
blue/violet light mode has the same characteristics and technology as
CureLight’s iClear (K030338). In contrast tothe iClear that is intended to
treat inflammatory acne lesions, the ReClear™ emits also infrared light that
is intended to temporary increase in local blood circulation, temporary relief of
minor muscle and joint aches, pains and stiffness and relaxation of muscles; for
muscle spasms, minor pain and stiffness associated with arthritis. The ReClear™
infrared mode is substantially equivalent to Light Force Therapy, Acubeam
(K001179), and MedX Health Corp. , MedX 1000 series , (K020017) and C&H
International Inc.’s TDP lamp (C&H international Inc.) (K020851) all of which
FDA has already cleared for the same intended use and indications. Thus,
ReClear™ is substantially equivalent to its predicate devices.
