Name of the Device: Polaris WR, ST Applicator
Predicate Devices: This is a Special 510(k) for the Polaris WR that was cleared
under K031671.
Device Description: The Polaris WR is a device that is used for non invasive wrinkle
treatment. The Polaris WR treatment is based on the principle of selective
(electromagnetic) thermolysis. According to this principle, parameters of optical and
RF energy (spectrum, exposure duration and energy density) are chosen and
optimized to selectively heat the skin without damaging the epidermis layer.
The Polaris WR is intended for non invasive wrinkle treatment.
The modifications to the Polaris WR, ST applicator do not affect the intended use or
alter the fundamental scientific technology of the device. The only device
modification is changing the output wavelengths spectrum from 780-980 nm in the
original Polaris WR to 700 — 2000 nm on the new Polaris WR, ST applicator.
There are no labeling changes that affect the intended use of the device. The device
modifications raise no new issues of safety or effectiveness.
