Name of the Device: Polaris WR
Predicate Devices: The Polaris WR is substantially equivalent to a combination of
3 laser powered surgical instruments (21 CFR 878.4810,
procode GEX): Polaris LV, manufactured by Syneron Medical
Ltd. and subject of K030186; Coolglide, manufactured by
Altus Medical Inc. and subject of K023954; ThermaCool TC,
Manufactured by Thermage Inc. and subject of K030142.
Device Description: The Polaris WR is a device that is used for non invasive
wrinkles treatment. The Polaris WR treatment is based on the
principle of selective (electromagnetic) thermolysis. According
to this principle, parameters of optical and RF cnergy
(spectrum, exposure duration and energy density) are chosen
and optimized to selectively damage to the treatment target
without damaging the surrounding tissues.
The Polaris WR is intended for use in dermatology for non ivasive wrinkles treatment.
Based upon an analysis of the overall performance characteristic for the device,
Syneron Medical Ltd. believes that no significant differences present. Therefore the
Polaris WR should raise no new issues of safety or effectiveness.
