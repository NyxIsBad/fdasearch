¢ HALO” Energy Generator model 1100C-115C (K060169) manufactured by
Stellartech Research;

« HALO Energy Generator model 1100C-115B (K051168) manufactured by
Stellartech Research;

* Stellartech Coagulation System 2, model 1100C-115A (K050831)
manufactured by Stellartech Research;

6. Intended Use / Indications for Use
The HALO” Coagulation System intended use is for the coagulation of bleeding and
non-bleeding sites in the gastrointestinal tract.

The HALO® Coagulation System is indicated for use in the coagulation of bleeding
and non-bleeding sites in the gastrointestinal tract including but not limited to, the
esophagus. Indications include Esophageal Ulcers, Mallory-Weiss tears,
Arteriovenous Malformations, Angiomata, Barrett’s Esophagus, Dieulafoy Lesions,
and Angiodysplasia.

q. Technological Characteristics

The HALO Coagulation System consists of the HALO” Energy
Generator model 90-9000 with a disposable single-use HALO” Coagulation
Catheter, output cable, and a footswitch. The HALO Coagulation System
performance and mode of operation is substantially equivalent to the already
cleared HALO” Coagulation System, HALO%° Coagulation System, and Stellartech
Coagulation System 2.

HALO” Coagulation Catheter

There are no changes associated with the HALO® Coagulation Catheter model
1520F.

HALO® Energy Generator

The HALO” Energy Generator model 90-9000 is configured with an
output cable (model 90-9010), a footswitch (model 90-9020) and a power cord.

The HALO® Coagulation Generator supplies up to 150 watts of
radiofrequency power at 460 kHz in a bipolar mode under power control while
continuously monitoring and displaying power density, and energy density. Energy

density and power are displayed to allow homogeneous energy delivery equivalent
to the HALO Energy Generator model 1100C-115C.

8. Substantial Equivalence

The HALO” Coagulation System (generator model 90-9000) and the
predicate devices: HALO* Coagulation System (generator model 1100C-115C),
HALO*° Coagulation System and Stellartech Coagulation System 2 have the same
or similar intended use, indications for use, technological characteristics, and
principles of operation. The technological differences between the HALOS
Coagulation System and its predicates are:
(1) Simplification of the generator and elimination of the unused pneumatic systems
for inflation/deflation capability;
(2) Changes in the hardware implemented to establish an optimum RF power
output for the impedance range defined for the clinical application;
(3) Minor modification of the generator software to support the changes in the
hardware design.
(4) Change of the design and manufacturing facility to the Aubrey Group;
All these differences were evaluated on bench and did not raise questions regarding
safety and efficacy. Thus the devices are equivalent.

Dear Mr. Kahan:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class If (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
