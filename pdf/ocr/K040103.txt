4. Device Description
The Soundskin Phototherapy System is a visible light source of high spectral
purity, it provides uniform illumination of red light and blue light within the
same lamp housing, The output is pre-tuned to one wavelength for each
light, with a narrow spectral bandwidth of 635 +/-5nm for red light and an
output of 435 +/-Snm bandwidth for blue light. The light output is 2460 mW
per sq cm of the treatment area with a lamp efficiency of 95% of the output.
This compares with laser outputs which are approximately 2300-2500 mW
per sq cm of area covered when measured in joules the output can average
between 15 and 60) per sq cm. We have supplied technical data sheets and
charls for the information requested.
The Soundskin system is in three parts, the base unit contains the power
supply and electronic contral unit, the programme is electronic timed
through mechanical relays instead of sofiware for simplicity and reliability.
The red light runs for 10 minutes then changes to blue light for 10 minutes,
a the end of the 20 minute cycle it automatically shuts aff. There is a
separale mains supply switch attached to the base unit and a single on off
switch on the lamp housing everything ix automatic operation. A three part
arm attached to the base unit supports the lamp housing, the head is
attached to the end of the arm with a multifunctional positioning for patient
(reatment. The automatic controlled electronics operate from a single reset
button on the lamp housing for easy access,
5. Indications for use
The Soundskin Phototherapy System is generally indicated to treat
dermatological conditions, specifically indicated to treat moderate
inflammatory Acne Vulgaris.
6. Performance data
Based upon an analysis of the overall performance characteristics for the
Soundskin Light device, BHC International believes that no significant
differences exist between this system and the predicate system quoted.
Therefore, the Soundskin Phototherapy System raises no new ivsues of
safety and the clinical trials prove the effectiveness is the same.

Dear Mr. Breen:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean

CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
