Intended Use / Indications for Use
The GentleWaves Consumer LED Photomodulation Device is
intended/indicated for over-the-counter use in the treatment of periorbital
wrinkles and rhytides.

Technological Characteristics
The GentleWaves Consumer is a hand-held device consisting of a low
intensity light emitting diode (LED) lamp placed in contact with the skin at a
fixed distance determined by its lens cover. The device components include
an LED array, a lens, a handpiece, three circuit boards, a power supply
enclosure and power supply.

Performance Data
Performance testing of the GentleWaves Consumer demonstrates no
significant difference in spectral content as compared to the cleared
GentleWaves device (K031425). Thus, performance and safety testing
obtained for the cleared GentleWaves is fully applicable to the GentleWaves
Consumer. In addition, a user study was performed to confirm that lay users
were able to use the GentleWaves Consumer in accordance with its
instructions for use.

Substantial Equivalence
The GentleWaves Consumer is as safe and effective as the GentleWaves LED
Photomodulation System. The GentleWaves Consumer has the same
intended uses and similar indications, technological characteristics, and
principles of operation as its predicate device. The minor technological
differences between the GentleWaves Consumer and its predicate device
raise no new issues of safety or effectiveness. In addition, the difference in
indication as an OTC device does not affect the device’s therapeutic effect.
Thus, the GentleWave Consumer is substantially equivalent.

Dear Mr. Kahan:
This letter corrects our substantially equivalent letter of June 26, 2008.
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices,
good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be
found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to continue marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
