Conclusion:
All applications of the Ellipse PPL (DD) are included in the Ellipse Flex PPT.
StarLux™ (Palomar Medical Technologies, Inc.) as a broader range of applications than
Ellipse Flex PPT, the intended use for Ellipse Flex PPT is covered by the StarLux™
Lumenis One of the Lumenis Family of IPL (Lumenis, Inc.) has a broader range of
applications than Ellipse Flex PPT as Lumenis One includes a Laser module for vascular
treatment applications in addition to the IPL modules. Ellipse Flex PPT does not employ a
Laser module, only IPL. Ellipse Flex PPT thus utilizes a subset of the Lumenis One
technologies.

The Ellipse Flex PPT has been evaluated and compared to the above systems and to their
application modules (to Ellipse PPL (DDD), Lumenis One (Lumenis, Inc.) ,and StarLux™
(Palomar Medical Technologies, Inc.). The Ellipse Flex PPT system, as far as the identical
modules, applications and intended uses are concerned, are judged to be identical to Ellipse
PPL and substantially equivalent to the Lumenis One (Lumenis, Inc.) ,and StarLux™
(Palomar Medical Technologies, Inc.) (predicate devices cleared in K043255, K041086 and,
K030342 respectively)

Based on this analysis of the overall performance characteristics of the mentioned predicate
devices Danish Dermatologic Development A/S believes that no significant differences exist.
The Ellipse Flex PPT system should not raise new issues of safety and effectiveness and is
judged to be substantially equivalent to the mentioned predicate devices.

Dear Ole Kofod:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for
use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce
prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good
manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be
found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish

systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation
control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
