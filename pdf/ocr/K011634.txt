Intended Uses

e The ENTec ReFlex Wand is indicated for ablation and coagulation of soft tissue in
otolaryngological (ENT) procedures, including the treatment of snoring, nasal airway
obstruction by reduction of hypertrophic nasal turbinates, and submucosal tissue
shrinkage.

* The ArthroCare System 2000 is indicated for resection, ablation, and coagulation of
soft tissues and hemostasis of blood vessels in orthopedic, arthroscopic, spinal, and

_ neurosurgical procedures.
: * The ENTec Surgery System is intended for ablation and coagulation of soft tissue in
otorhinolaryngology (ENT) surgery including head, neck, oral, and sinus surgery.

* The ArthroCare Orthopedic Electrosurgery System is indicated for resection,
ablation, and coagulation of soft tissues and hemostasis of blood vessels in
orthopedic, arthroscopic, and spinal procedures. .

* The ArthroCare Electrosurgery System is indicated for resection, ablation, and
coagulation of soft tissue and hemostasis of blood vessels in general, plastic, and
reconstructive surgery. It is intended to be used in procedures using conductive
solutions, such as normal saline.

« The Visage Cosmetic Surgery System is a bipolar electrosurgical device intended for
general dermatologic surgery that may include skin resurfacing for the treatment of
wrinkles, rhytids, and furrows, as well as soft tissue resection/removal and .
hemostasis/coagulation. It is intended to be used in procedures using conductive
solutions such as normal saline.

¢ The ArthroCare Bipolar Loop is indicated for resection, ablation, and excision, as
well as hemostasis of blood vessels in patients requiring endoscopic surgery for
general urological procedures including transurethral prostatectomy (TURP),
transurethral incisions in the prostate (TUIP), and non-malignant tumors of the
bladder wall.

Product Description

The ArthroCare Electrosurgery Systems are bipolar, high frequency electrosurgical

Systems consisting of three components: an electrosurgical generator called the System

2000 Controller, a disposable bipolar single use Wand designed for specific indications,

and the reusable patient Cable.

Substantial Equivalence
This Special 510(k) proposes a modification in materials to the Wand component of the
Electrosurgery Systems, which were previously cleared in K000778 (May 3, 2000),
K001588 (August 17, 2000), K001936 (July 19, 2000), K003624 (December 20, 2000),
and K010568 (March 27, 2001). The technology, principle of operation, intended uses,
performance specifications, dimensional specifications, labeling, packaging, and

: sterilization parameters of the Electrosurgery Systems remain the same as in the
previously cleared 510(k)s.
Summary of Safety and Effectiveness
The modified Wand component of the Electrosurgery Systems, as described in this .
submission, is substantially equivalent to the predicate Wands. The proposed
modification in materials is not a substantial change or modification, and does not
significantly affect the safety or efficacy of the devices.

: Dear Mr. Prothro:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) notification of intent to market the device referenced
above and we have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use
stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce
prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act (Act). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls
provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual
registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against
misbranding and adulteration. _
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class IIT
(Premarket Approval), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations
affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 895.
A substantially equivalent determination assumes compliance with the Current Good
Manufacturing Practice requirements, as set forth in the Quality System Regulation (QS) for
Medical Devices: General regulation (21 CFR Part 820) and that, through periodic QS
inspections, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will verify such assumptions. Failure to :

comply with the GMP regulation may result in regulatory action. In addition, FDA may publish
further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register. Please note: this
response to your premarket notification submission does not affect any obligation you might
have under sections 531 through 542 of the Act for devices under the Electronic Product
Radiation Control provisions, or other Federal laws or regulations. :
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your 510(k) premarket
notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed
predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to
proceed to the market. ;
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801 and
additionally 809.10 for in vitro diagnostic devices), please contact the Office of Compliance at
(301) 594-4659. Additionally, for questions on the promotion and advertising of your device,
please contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4639. Also, please note the regulation
entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR 807.97). Other general
information on your responsibilities under the Act may be obtained from the Division of Small
Manufacturers Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its
