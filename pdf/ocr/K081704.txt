D. DEVICE DESCRIPTION:
The Lumenis Selecta is a fully integrated, high-performance diagnostic slit
lamp and therapeutic laser delivery system. Selecta has all of the standard
controls and functions of a diagnostic slit lamp and is intended for use in eye
examination of the anterior segment, from the cornea epithelium to the
posterior capsule.
The Lumenis Selecta is also an ophthalmic surgical laser designed for
performing photodisruption of ocular tissue using laser energy emitted by a
Nd:YAG laser including discission of the posterior capsule of the eye
(posterior capsulotomy), discission of pupillary membranes (pupillary
membranectomy), and iridotomy/iridectomy; and selective laser
trabeculoplasty.
The Selecta Family of Ophthalmic Lasers is comprised of:
Selecta 1064: A Nd:YAG laser providing Q-switched laser pulses at a

wavelength of 1064 nm for use in photodisruption of ocular tissue
(posterior capsulotomy, papillary membranectomy, and iridotomy).
Selecta SLT; A Nd:YAG laser providing Q-switched laser pulses at a
wavelength of 532 nm for use in selective laser trabeculoplasty.
Selecta Duet: A Nd:YAG laser providing Q-switched laser pulses at a
wavelength of 1064 nm for use in photodisruption or Q-switched
frequency doubled laser pulses at a wavelength of 532 nm for use in
selective laser trabeculoplasty, depending on the mode selected.
LaserLink S: Laser delivery adapter that may be coupled to each of the
above Selecta models and connected to a currently cleared Lumenis
532 nm retinal photocoagulator (Novus Spectra, Novus Varia) to allow
use of the slit lamp to deliver 532 nm continuous wave laser energy for
retinal photocoagulation.
Selecta Duo: A Nd:YAG laser providing Q-switched laser pulses at a
wavelength of 1064 nm for use in photodisruption or Q-switched 532 nm
continuous wave laser energy for retinal photocoagulation.
Selecta Trio: A Nd:YAG laser providing Q-switched laser pulses at a
wavelength of 1064 nm for use in photodisruption, Q-switched frequency
doubled laser pulses at a wavelength of 532 nm for use in selective
laser trabeculoplasty, or Q-switched 532 nm continuous wave laser
energy for retinal photocoagulation, depending on the mode selected.
The Selecta produces short, individual pulses of focused laser light with
wavelengths of either 1064 nm or 532 nm, depending on the selected
operational mode. Using a slit lamp microscope and aiming beam, the
pulsed light is accurately targeted on a structure within the patient's eye.
When the photodisruptor mode is selected, the treatment wavelength is
1064 nm. A twin-aiming beam targets the area of tissue disruption. The
energy contained within a single short pulse is concentrated by focusing to
a very small spot size so that plasma formation occurs at the focal point.
This creates an acoustic wave which disrupts nearby tissue.
When the SLT mode is selected, the treatment wavelength is 532 nm. A
coaxial aiming beam targets the trabecular meshwork via a contact lens.
The SLT treatment laser provides a low energy, short pulse of laser light
that produces a thermal effect in pigmented cells in the trabecular
meshwork.
If the optional LaserLink S adapter is attached to the Selecta system and
the compatible Lumenis Spectra 532 nm retinal photocoagulator laser, the
Selecta works strictly as a diagnostic slit lamp — all photodisruptor and SLT
laser functions are disabled. The LaserLink S laser delivery adaptor is used
for treatments specifically cleared for the compatible laser retinal
photocoagulator.

The principles of operation and fundamental scientific technology are the
same for the subject devices and predicate devices.
E. INTENDED USE:
The intended use for the Selecta Family of Ophthalmic Laser Systems (Selecta
1064, Selecta SLT, Selecta Duet, LaserLink S, Selecta Duo, and Selecta Trio) and

treatment of ocular tissue. The laser delivery system is intended
for a variety of ophthalmic uses, including the indications specified
in the laser operator manual. Refer to the laser operator manual,
General Intended Use section.

Selecta Duo: Photodisruption of ocular tissue using light energy emitted by a
Nd:YAG laser, including discission of the posterior capsule of the
eye (posterior capsulotomy), and discission of pupillary
membranes (pupillary membranectomy) in aphakic and

photocoagulation.

Selecta Trio: Photodisruption of ocular tissue using light energy emitted by a
Nd:YAG laser, including discission of the posterior capsule of the
eye (posterior capsulotomy), and discission of pupillary
membranes (pupillary membranectomy) in aphakic and
pseudophakic patients, and iridotomy/iridectomy, __ retinal
photocoagulation and selective laser trabeculoplasty.

The intended use has not changed from the predicate devices (K021550,

K97340, KO22181).

F. TECHNOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS SUMMARY & SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE

The subject device, the Selecta Family of Laser Systems, has the same
intended use, general design and fundamental! scientific technology as the
predicate devices (K021550, K97340, KO22181).
The Selecta Family of Laser Systems uses technology substantially equivalent
to the Lumenis Selecta Duet (K021550), Coherent Popeye Ophthalmic Laser
System (EPIC | and EPIC IV), (K97340), and the LaserLink Z-1000 (2022181).
There are no new hazards introduced by the Selecta Family of Laser Systems
as compared with the predicate devices.

G. PERFORMANCE DATA SUMMARY:

The appropriate testing including safety, performance and functional testing to
determine substantial equivalence of the Selecta Family of Laser Systems
has been conducted.
