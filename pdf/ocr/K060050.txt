Intended Use / Indications for Use
The Model SF-2100-H MegaBeam SideFiber Fiber Optic Delivery System is
intended for use as a fiber optic delivery system in conjunction with any
Ho:YAG (holmium) surgical laser with SMA 905 compatible connector. The
MegaBeam SideFiber Fiber Optic Delivery System is indicated for
hemostasis, ablation and vaporization of soft or fibrous tissue in any surgical
discipline with a compatible laser marketed for the desired application. The
system can be used with or without a standard viewing scope. It can be
inserted through the working channel of a cystoscope, urethroscope, or any
other viewing scope.

Technological Characteristics
The SF-2100-H MegaBeam SideFiber Fiber Optic Delivery System consists of
quartz fiber core and a coaxially mounted protective sheath with a metal tip
at the distal end.

Performance Data
Bench test data was provided in support of the 510(k) notice.

Substantial Equivalence
The SF-2100-H MegaBeam SideFiber Fiber Optic Delivery System is as safe
and effective as the Biolitee MegaBeam Lateral Fiber (SideFiber) Fiber Optic
Delivery System. The MegaBeam Lateral Fiber Optic Delivery System has
the same intended uses and similar indications, technological characteristics,
and principles of operation as its predicate device. The minor technological
differences between the MegaBeam Fiber Optic Delivery System and its
predicate devices raise no new issues of safety or effectiveness. Thus, the
MegaBeam Fiber Optic Delivery System is substantially equivalent.

Dear Mr. Kahan:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA),
it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device
can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA
may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
: comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing

(21 CER Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your
device to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21 CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
