General Description:

The CardioFocus Diode Laser Ablation System is a generator designed for

the delivery of 980nm laser fight and may be used in conjunction with

surgical treatment for hemostasis, incision, ablation, coagulation and

vaporization of tissue as required by the clinician. The instrument includes a

diode laser module as the therapeutic energy source, as well as an internal

' thermal safety system for monitoring and disabling laser power output.

Device Characteristics:

The CardioFocus Laser Diode System is provided in two Models. The Model
30NR provides up to 30 watts, laser light and the Model 6ONR provides up
to 60 watts, laser light., The CardioFocus Diode Laser System may be used

with the CardioFocus Lightstic 180L or Lightstic 180C delivery catheter
(REF: 510K# K993834 and KO11988), and successor delivery catheters
from CardioFocus, Inc.

System safety characteristic are assured through conformance with
applicable U.S. and International standards, including :
« UL 2601-1 Medical Electrical Equipment PART 1: General
Requirements For Safety, Medical Electrical Equipment
* IEC 60601-2-22 Medical Electrical Equipment PART2: Particular
requirements for the safety of diagnostic and therapeutic laser
equipment

Technical Characteristics
» System Controller: the system controller represents the hardware
and software that monitors and controls the functioning of the laser
instrument.
* Thermal Safety System (TSS): the thermal safety system is a safety
, Circuit, intended to monitor the black body radiation associated with
excessive heating in the disposable device and associated optics
and to disable the laser in the event that excessive black body
radiation is detected.
« Optics Module: the optics module is an optical sub-system which
provides means for delivering laser energy and collecting white light
energy from the delivery device and also provides means for
directing black body radiation from the disposable device to the :
safety system IR detector.
e User Interface: the user interface provides means for information
display to the user as well as a mechanism for user input. The user
interface for the laser instrument will likely include an LCD display
and a keypad.
e Foot Switch: the laser instrument will interface to a foot switch for
on/off control of the laser emission.
¢ Diode Driver: the diode driver block represents the electronics
required to control power supplied to the laser module
* Diode Module: the diode module is a purchased component,
comprised of a series of laser diodes, which produces the output :
laser energy.
e Power Supply: an AC/DC power supply provides DC power |
necessary to run the system electronic components. The supply is |
internal to the laser instrument.

Predicate information is support of Substantial equivalence
The CardioFocus Diode Laser System is substantially equivalent to the
CeramOptec Celaras 025 Fiber-Coupled Diode Laser System. Both devices
provide laser energy at similar power levels and similar wavelengths, have
similar intended uses and provide for safety though conformance to
recognized standards.
Conclusion
There are more similarities than differences between the predicate device and
the CardioFocus Diode laser System. Both the predicate devices use the
same technology and theory of operation. Both the CardioFocus Laser
System and the Ceralas Diode laser System use three configurations for
different power levels and both devices have similar Indications for Use
When used in accordance with the directions for use, by qualified personnel,
the CardioFocus Diode Laser System is safe and effective, as indicated, for
its intended use,

Dear Mr. Greenbaum:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act |
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
