' The soft tissue applications are for the coagulation, photocoagulation,
incision/excision, ablation, and vaporization of soft tissues including skin,
cutaneous tissue, subcutaneous tissue, striated and smooth tissue, muscle,
cartilage meniscus, mucous membrane, lymph vessels and nodes, organs
and glands.
Dermatology: In addition to the tissue types cited, pigmented lesions to
reduce lesion size; for patients with lesions that would potentially benefit
from aggressive treatment; for patients with lesions that have not responded
to other laser treatments.
Endoscopic/Laparoscopic General Surgery: Incision/excision and cutting,
ablation, coagulation/hemostasis of soft tissue in endoscopic, laparoscopic
surgery applications, including but not limited to cholecystectomy,
appendectomy, vagotomy, and pyloromyotomy.
Gastroenterology: Tissue ablation and hemostasis in the GI tract,
esophageal neoplastic obstructions including squamous cell carcinoma and
adenocarcinoma; GI hemostasis; including varices, esophagitis, esophageal
ulcer, Mallory-Weiss tear, gastric ulcer, angiodysplasia, stomal ulcers, nonbleeding ulcers gastric erosions GI tissue ablation including benign and
malignant neoplasms, angiodysplasia, polyps, ulcer, colitis, and
hemorrhoids.
General Surgery: Soft tissue in general surgery applications, skin incisions,
tissue dissection, excision of external tumors and lesions, complete or partial
resection of internal organs, tumors, lesions, tissue ablation, vessel
coagulation.

: Gynecology: Treatment of menorrhagia by photocoagulation of thee
endometrial lining of the uterus, ablation of endometrial implants and/or
peritoneal adhesions, soft tissue excision procedures such as conization of
the cervix, intra-uterine gynecologic procedures where cutting, ablation
and/or vessel coagulation may be indicated including submucous fibroids,
benign endometrial polyps, uterine septum.

Head and Neck/Otorhinolaryngology (ENT): For the coagulation,
photocoagulation, incision/excision, ablation, and vaporization of soft tissue.
Hemostasis during surgery: Adjunctive coagulation and hemostasis (control
of bleeding) during surgery (endoscopic, laparoscopic, and open
procedures).

Neurosurgery: Hemostasis of pituitary tumor, meningioma, hemagioblastoma, AVMs, glioma, glioblastoma, astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma.

: Oculoplastics: Incision, excision, vaporization, ablation, and coagulation of
soft tissues in oculoplastic procedures such as operations on the lacrimal
system, operation on the eyelids, removal of biopsy or orbital tumors,
enucleation of the eyeball, exteneration of orbital contents.
Orthopedics: Incision, excision, cutting, ablation and/or hemostasis of intraarticular tissue in orthopedic surgical and arthroscopic applications.
Plastic Surgery: Incision, excision, cutting, coagulation, and vaporization
soft tissue.
Pulmonary/Thoracic Surgery: Palliative treatment of benign and malignant
pulmonary airway obstructions including squamous cell carcinoma,
adenocarcinoma, carcinoid, benign tumors, granulomas, and benign
strictures.
Thoracic Surgery: Incision, excision, cutting, coagulation, and vaporization
of soft tissue, including lung tissue, in thoracic applications including but
not limited to isolation of vessels for endarterectomy and/or by-pass grafts,
wedge resections, thoractomy, formation of pacemaker pockets.
Urology: All applications including superficial urinary bladder tumors,
invasive bladder carcinoma, urethral strictures, and lesions of the external
genitalia (including condyloma accuminata).
The Athos laser will be labeled as a prescription device:
CAUTION: Federal (US) law restricts the use of this device to licensed professionals.
Performance Data: None required.
CONCLUSION:
Based on the information in the notification Quantel Medical concludes that the Athos laser
which is the subject of this notification is substantially equivalent to the Athos laser
described in K001704 under the conditions of intended use.

Dear Mr. Barnes:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. ‘The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class IT (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 — Mr. Roger W. Barnes ,
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
