510(k) SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS SUMMARY
Trade Name: Bovie Remote Hand Switch
Common Name: Hand Switching Device
Classification Name: Electrosurgical Cutting and Coagulation Devices and
Accessories (per 21CFR 878.4400)

The Bovie Remote Hand Switch is a sterile, single-use electrosurgical accessory that is used to
activate the CUT and COAGULATION modes of an electrosurgical generator, which operates an
attached monopolar accessory. The switch also serves as the connection between a monopolar
electrosurgical accessory and the generator. The Bovie Remote Hand Switch provides an
alternative to the use of footswitch control to deliver RF energy to an attached monopolar
accessory.
The Bovie Remote Hand Switch is substantially equivalent to the Valleylab Inc. E0520 Trigger
Switch and Cord (K970140) in operation, intended use, materials, energy source, components,
and safety/performance claims.
Testing performed on the Bovie Remote Hand Switch indicates that the device is substantially
equivalent in its performance and method of operation to the Valleylab Inc. E0520 Trigger
Switch and Cord (K970140). Hazard analysis evaluations were performed on the Bovie Remote
Hand Switch. There are no new hazards presented with the use of the Bovie Remote Hand Switch
as compared with the predicate device. Both the Remote Hand Switch and the predicate device
were designed and tested to meet the ANSI/AAMI HF 18 Electrosurgical Device standard.
In conclusion, the Bovie Remote Hand Switch is substantially equivalent to the predicate device
(Valleylab Inc. E0520 Trigger Switch and Cord (K970140)) in methods of operation, intended
use, and results derived from operation.
