Predicate Devices:
The Opus 10™ Dental Diode Laser System with the tooth whitening application
is substantially equivalent to the Opus 10™ Dental Diode Laser System
(OpusDent Ltd.) in terms of, technological characteristics, performance,
intended use (generally), indications for use and user interface.
In addition, the Opus 10™ is substantially equivalent to a combination of the
Twilite™ Dental Diode Laser system (Biolase Technology, Inc.), to the
Aurora™ Diode Laser System (Premier Laser Systems, Inc.) and to the
Dentek™ LD 15 Diode laser (Dentek™ Austria GMBH) in terms of intended
use, indication for use, technological characteristics and performance.
Performance Standards:

The Opus 10™ Diode Laser complies with:
USS. Federal Performance Standards 21 CFR 1040.10 and 21 CFR 1040.11 for
class IV Laser Products.
In addition, the device complies with the European Medical Directive

' 93/42,EEC conceming medical devices (Annex II) and with the voluntary
standards, EN 60601-1, EN-60825-1, EN-601-2-22, CISPR 11, IEC 61000-42/3/4/5, EN55011 and IEC 801-2

Intended Use / Indication for Use:
The Opus 10™ Dental Diode Laser System is intended for incision, excision,
ablation, vaporization and/or coagulation (hemostasis) of oral soft tissue
(including marginal and interdental gingiva and epithelial lining of free gingiva). In
addition, the system is intended for teeth whitening.
The Indications for Use of the Opus 10™ Dental Diode Laser System include:
Cosmetic Dentistry
¢ Light activation for bleaching materials for teeth whitening
*  Laser-assisted bleaching/whitening of the teeth
Endodontology
*  Pulpotomy
¢  Pulpotomy as an adjunct to root canal therapy
Periodontology
«  Sulcular debridement (removal of diseased or inflamed soft tissue in the
periodental pocket)
Oral Soft Tissue Surgery
* Biopsy
*  Operculectomy
*  Gingivectomy
*  Gingivoplasty
*  Papillectomy
... Lesion (tumor) removal
¢ Leukoplakia
* Treatment of aphthous ulcers
¢  Fibroma removal
*  Frenectomies and frenotomies
¢ Tissue retraction for impressions
«  Incising and draining of abscesses
¢ Exposure of unerupted teeth
Device Description:
The Opus 10™ Dental Diode Laser is designed to perform several medical
procedures in the oral soft tissue and to perform laser assisted aesthetic tooth
whitening procedures.
A Gallium Aluminum Arsenide (GaAlAs) solid state laser diode provides optical
energy to oral soft tissues.

A fiber optic held by an handpiece delivers the Opus 10™ laser energy. A visible

light emitted from the handpiece’s distal end targets the area of treatment. The

optical power output and pulse may be adjusted to specific use requirements.
Substantial Equivalence:

There are no unique applications, indications, material or specifications presented

herein. Evidence of equivalence has been demonstrated through:

. The Opus 10™ intended use and indications for use were previously
cleared by FDA for the predicate devices.

e The technical characteristics of the Opus 10™ with the tooth whitening
application are similar to those of the cleared Opus 10™, Twilite™,
Aurora™ and Dentek™.

° Laser output values of the Opus 10™ are well within previous cleared
values of the predicate dental diode laser systems as described.

° The predicate devices and other previous cleared lasers with similar energy
output has a proven safety and effectiveness in the treatment of the claimed
indications.

° Safety and performance testing.

Therefore, the Opus 10™ Dental Diode Laser System with the tooth whitening

application is substantially equivalent to its predicate devices cited above and

raises no new safety and/or effectiveness issues.

Dear Ms. Friedman:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) notification of intent to market the device referenced
above and we have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use
stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce
prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act (Act). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls
provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual
registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against
. misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III
(Premarket Approval), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations
affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 895.
A substantially equivalent determination assumes compliance with the Current Good
Manufacturing Practice requirements, as set forth in the Quality System Regulation (QS) for
Medical Devices: General regulation (21 CFR Part 820) and that, through periodic QS
inspections, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will verify such assumptions. F ailure to
comply with the GMP regulation may result in regulatory action. In addition, FDA may publish
further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register. Please note: this
response to your premarket notification submission does not affect any obligation you might
have under sections 531 through 542 of the Act for devices under the Electronic Product
Radiation Control provisions, or other Federal laws or regulations.
