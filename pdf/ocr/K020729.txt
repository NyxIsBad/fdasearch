5. Indications for Use
The NLite system is indicated for use in the specialties of Dermatology and Plastic
Surgery applications, and in particular for the treatment of Vascular lesions, such as
Port Wine Stains, Telangiectasia, Leg Veins, Spider Veins, Spider Naevus,
Poikiloderma of civatte, Hemangiomas, Angiomas, Rosacea
And benign cutaneous lesion, such as: Scars, Straie, Psoriasis, Verrucae Vulgaris and
Warts.
6. Rationale for Substantial Equivalence
The key laser parameters, namely wavelength, pulse duration, energy density and
delivery mechanism, produced by the NLite System are equivalent to both the
predicate devices. The specific indications for use for the NLite System are identical
that of the predicate. There is an identical interaction in the specific targeting of the
Vasculature within the dermal region of the skin. The predicate devices are intended
to produce permanent damage to the vasculature as is the NLite System.
As far as technological considerations are concerned, the NLite System utilizes the
same design principles as the predicate devices, namely the method of producing the
laser output is identical. More specifically, the laser output parameters and delivery
method are equivalent in nature to those provided by the predicate devices.
7. Safety and Efficacy Information
None required ~ The precise equivalence to predicate devices negate the need to
support additional efficacy information.
8. Conclusion
The NLite System has been found to be substantially equivalent to the predicate
devices, specifically in technological design resulting in identical desired
physiological interactions. The design and manufacture of the device is in accordance
with the relative international standards and the potential risk to operator and patient
has been minimized.

Dated: February 28, 2002
Received: March 6, 2002
Dear Mr. Mortimer:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration. ,
If your device is classified (see above) into either class IT (Special Controls) or class [iI (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Page 2 - Mr. Ian Mortimer
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
: marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801 and
additionally 21 CFR Part 809.10 for in vitro diagnostic devices), please contact the Office of
Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Additionally, for questions on the promotion and advertising of
, your device, please contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4639. Also, please note the
