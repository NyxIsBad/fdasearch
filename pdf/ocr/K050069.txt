Contact Person: Kathy Maynor
Summary Preparation Date: November 19, 2004
il. Names
Device Names: Cutera Flashlamp Tabletop Aesthetic Product
Primary Classification Name: Laser Powered Surgical Instrument (and
Accessories) 878.4810 - GEX
III. Predicate Devices

IV. Product Description
The Cutera Flashlamp Tabletop Aesthetic Product consists of a modified console
designed to drive the pulsed light hand pieces, which are all existing, FDA cleared
devices. The hand pieces are pulsed light devices with a variable emission of 5001300nm. The delivered wavelength is filtered to various desired wavelength
bands within the 500-1300nm range via coated glass filters to eliminate the
extraneous wavelengths.
The Cutera Flashlamp Tabletop Aesthetic Product is comprised of five main
components:
« a system console (including software and control electronics),
¢ acontrol and display panel;

¢ a detachable hand picce with integrated skin cooling;
¢ a foot-operated exposure switch (footswitch); and
«a remote interlock connector (disables emission when treatment room door is
opened).
The proximal end of the umbilical cable is semi-permanently attached to the
system console and the distal end is permanently attached to the body of the
delivery hand piece. This hand piece is removable by either the user or an
authorized field service engineer for replacement at the proximal end.
V. Indications for Use
The Cutera Flashlamp Tabletop Aesthetic Product is indicated for the treatment of
benign pigmented lesions.
VI. Rationale for Substantial Equivalence
The Cutera Flashlamp Tabletop Aesthetic Product shares the same general
indications for use, and therefore is substantially equivalent to the currently cleared
pulsed light hand piece (K023954) and the currently cleared tabletop console
(K042165). No clinical data is required.
VII. Safety and Effectiveness Information
The indication for use is exactly the same as the previously cleared pulsed light
hand piece (K023954).
Technologically, the Cutera Flashlamp Tabletop Product is substantially
equivalent to the listed predicate devices. Therefore the risks and benefits for the
Cutera Flashlamp Tabletop Product are comparable to the predicate devices.
We therefore believe that there are no new questions of safety or effectiveness
raised by the introduction of this device.
VH. Conclusion
The Cutera Flashlamp Tabletop Aesthetic Product was found to be substantially
equivalent to the currently cleared Cutera pulsed light hand piece (K023954) and
Cutera tabletop console (K042165). The Cutera Flashlamp Tabletop Aesthetic
Product shares similar indications for use, design features, and similar functional
features as, and thus is substantially equivalent to the currently marketed predicate
devices.

You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of

be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition. FDA may
