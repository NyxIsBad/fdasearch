Device Unipolar laparoscopic/endoscopic instruments are electrosurgical

description: instruments consisting of a rigid plastic handpiece with loop handles
connected to the distal end effector jaw by an elongated, narrowdiameter insulated barrel or shaft. The devices are designed to be
inserted through an appropriately sized trocar sleeve or cannula. The
jaws are operated by the handpiece loop handles and may be shaped
as scissors, dissectors or graspers. The jaws of some models may be
rotated by manipulating controls on the handpiece.
The blades or jaws of unipolar laparoscopic/endoscopic instruments can
deliver a cauterizing current that enters the instrument through the
unipolar cautery connector on the handpiece, runs down the insulated
shaft and through the tissue in the blades or jaws.

Intended use: Reprocessed unipolar laparoscopic/endoscopic instruments, including
scissors, dissectors, and graspers are intended for use in minimally
invasive surgical procedures.

Indications Reprocessed unipolar laparoscopic/endoscopic instruments, including

statement: scissors, dissectors, and graspers, are to be used for patients requiring
minimally invasive surgical procedures to manipulate and manage
internal soft tissue by grasping, cutting, dissecting, cauterizing, or
coagulating tissue. :

Technological The intended use and technological features of the reprocessed devices do

characteristics: not differ from the legally marketed predicate device(s). | Both the

reprocessed device(s) and the predicate device(s) have the same materials
and product design. The technological characteristics of the reprocessed
unipolar laparoscopic/endoscopic scissors, dissectors, and graspers are the
same as those of the legally marketed predicate devices.
Alliance Medical — Corporation’s reprocessing of unipolar
laparoscopic/endoscopic instruments includes removal of adherent visible
soil and decontamination. All unipolar laparoscopic/endoscopic instruments
are tested for electrical continuity. Unipolar laparoscopic/endoscopic
scissors are tested for cutting function. Graspers and dissectors are tested
for the ability of the jaws to grasp appropriately.

Performance _ Performance data demonstrates that Reprocessed Unipolar

data: Laparoscopic/Endoscopic Instruments perform as originally intended.

Conclusion: In accordance with the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21
CFR Part 807 and based on the information provided in this
premarket notification, Alliance Medical Corporation concludes that
the modified device (Reprocessed Unipolar Laparoscopic/Endoscopic
Instruments) is safe, effective and substantially equivalent to the
predicate devices as described herein.

Dear Mr. Selvey:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 — Mr. Don Selvey
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801 and
additionally 21 CFR Part 809.10 for in vitro diagnostic devices), please contact the Office of
Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Additionally, for questions on the promotion and advertising of
your device, please contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4639. Also, please note the
