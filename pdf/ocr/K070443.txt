3. Device Name
Trade Name: INTRACEPT Bi-Polar RF Probe and Instrument Set
Common Name: Radiofrequency Probe
Classification Name: Radiofrequency Lesion Probe
4, Date Summary Prepared
September 27, 2007
5. Predicate Devices
-Neurotherm Disposable Radiofrequency Cannula (K994344)
-InCircle Bi-Polar RF Ablation Device (K070711)
-Stryker RF Coaxial Bipolar Electrodes and Cannulae (K043442)
6. Description of Device
The Relievant INTRACEPT Bi-Polar RF Probe and Instrument Sets are used
in conjunction with the Stockert NEURO NSO RF Generator and Interconnect
Cable to create radiofrequency lesions in soft tissue. The system delivers
temperature-controlled, radiofrequency (RF) energy into targeted tissue via
the probe to create lesions in soft tissue. The Instrument Sets are used to
provide access to the target tissue and are available in a Standard Length and
an Extra Length version.
7. Intended Use
The INTRACEPT Bi-Polar RF Probe and Instrument Set is intended to be
used with radiofrequency (RF) generators for the thermal coagulation of soft
tissues.
8. Comparison of Technological Characteristics
The INTRACEPT Bi-Polar RF Probe and Instrument Set are substantially
equivalent in design, materials, function and intended use to the following
devices cleared for commercial distribution:

KO710443

-Neurotherm Disposable Radiofrequency Cannula (K994344)

-InCircle Bi-Polar RF Ablation Device (K070711)

-Stryker RF Coaxial Bipolar Electrodes and Cannulae (K043442) faye aQ 4 (2)
9. Summary of Performance Data

The INTRACEPT Bi-Polar RF Probe and Instrument Set was tested and

compared to predicate devices. In vivo data demonstrated that the

INTRACEPT Bi-Polar RF Probe and Instrument Set creates clinically relevant

lesions that are equivalent in size to the predicate device. The test data

gathered demonstrate that this device is substantially equivalent to the

predicate devices. No new safety or effectiveness issues have been raised.

Trade/Device Name: INTRACEPT Bi-Polar RF Probe and Instrument Set

Regulation Number: 21 CFR 878.4400

Regulation Name: Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation device and accessories

Regulatory Class: II

Product Code: GEI

Dated: September 27, 2007

Received: September 28, 2007
Dear Mr. Smutka:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination docs not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
“Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
