Performance Standards
LITEDUO Dental Laser System complies with U.S. Federal Performance
Standards 21 CFR 1040.10 and 21 CFR 1040.11 for class IV Laser
Products.

e In addition, the device complies with the European Medical Directive
93/42/EEC concerning medical devices (Annex ID) and with the
following voluntary standards:

¢ EN 6060I-1 (Medical Electrical Equipment-Part 1: General
Requirements for Safety-1. Collateral Standard: Safety Requirements
for Medical Electrical Systems).

© EN 60825-I (Safety of laser products);

¢ EN 60601-2-22 (Medical device equipment, Particular Requirements
for the safety and diagnostics and therapeutic laser equipment).

* IEC 60601-1-2 (Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC)

A detailed description appears in Section 14.
Summary of Clinical performance data
The safety and efficacy of Er: YAG Laser devices with wavelength of 2.94
micron and power up to 8.4 Watts, and Diode Laser devices with
wavelength of 0.98 micron and power up to 7 Watts are well established

in scientific research and literature including procedures performed in hard
and soft oral tissue, Cosmetic Endodontology and Periodontology.
Due to the comprehensive animal and clinical study performed in
scientific research and published in literature, and since the power,
wavelength, pulse duration and frequency of the LITEDUO Dental Laser
System are well within the previous cleared values, Light Instruments
believes that animal and clinical studies are not required to determine the
safety and efficacy of the device.

Dear Mr. Levy:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
: for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II[ (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean

: or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
: marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
