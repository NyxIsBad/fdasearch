Predicate Device

SLT Thermalite Diode Laser Series: 980, 810, 940 (K952661)
Description of Device
The PhoTex;s Diode Laser Series are diode lasers emitting radiation in either a continuous-wave
(CW) or pulsed-mode in the infrared range at one of the following wavelengths: 980nm, 810nm,
and 940nm, The PhoTex;s Diode Laser Series provides a means for cutting, coagulation, and
vaporization of tissue using a compatible fiber optic delivery accessory. The laser is compatible
with any fiber optic delivery accessory terminated with a standard SMA905 connector whose core
fiber diameter is 400 micron or larger with a numerical aperture of at least .37.
Indications for Use
The PhoTex15 Diode Laser Series is indicated for use in surgical applications requiring the
ablation, vaporization, excision, incision, and coagulation of soft tissue in areas of surgery
including: gastroenterology, general surgery, plastic surgery. genitourinary (urology),
gynecology (GYN), neurosurgery, otolaryngology (ENT) head and neck, orthopedics,
ophthalmology, pulmonology, and thoracic surgery.

Comparison to Predicate Device ,

The PhoTex;s Diode Laser Series has been shown to be substantially equivalent to the predicate
devices, the SLT Thermalite Diode Laser Series and PhotoMedex LaserPro Diode Laser
Systems. Based on the technological features, device performance, and indications for use,
BioTex, Inc. believes that no significant differences exist between the PhoTex,, Diode Laser
Series and the predicate device. Differences were determined to be minor and are each within
the specifications listed by the predicate device and does not raise any concems regarding the
overall safety and effectiveness of the device.
Non-clinical Performance Tests:
Engineering studies have demonstrated the substantial equivalence of the PhoTex,s Diode Laser
Series to the SLT Thermalite Diode Laser Series (K 952661).
The studies concluded that the lasers are in compliance with FDA standards 21CFR1040,10 and
21CFR1040.11. In all instances, the jasers functioned as intended and performed in a manner
similar to the predicate device when used in accordance with the labeled directions for use and
specified indications,
Conclusion
BioTex has demonstrated the PhoTex,,; Diode Laser Series is substantially equivalent to the
predicate device based on design, test results, and indications for use.

Dear Mr. Fox:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstaic
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments. sr to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The

general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of

devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class [{f (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050. :
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k}
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
