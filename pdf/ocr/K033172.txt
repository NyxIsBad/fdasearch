UI. Names
Device Trade Name: GentleYAG Family of Laser Systems
Common Name Dermatology Laser
Classification: Class II (21 CFR § 878.4810 Laser Surgical
Instrument for use in General and Plastic
Surgery and in Dermatology)
IU. Predicate Devices
Candela GentleYAG a.k.a Long Pulse Nd:YAG Laser (K010104, K0022923.
K022951, K023193), Lyra I (K020021,K003765, K003147) Altus CoolGlide
Family of Lasers (K023954, K010834,K003765)
IV. Product Description
The Candela GentleYAG Family of Laser Systems is a flashlamp-excited, Nd:
YAG(Neodymium-doped Yttrium Aluminum Gamet) laser. Pulsed laser
energy at a nominal wavelength of 1064 nanometers (nm) is used. This
wavelength causes maximum energy absorption by the target (hair or lesion)
and minimum absorption by surrounding skin structures. In addition, the laser
pulse duration is controlled to be equal to or shorter than the thermal relaxation
time of the target, to minimize heat transfer to surrounding tissues.
The GentleY AG consists of the following main components:
a laser system console (including software and control electronics)
a control and display panel
a lens-coupled, user replacement optical fiber handpiece with aiming beam
a footswitch or handswitch
a remote interlock connector
an optional cooling device

V. Indications for Use
The GentleYAG Family of Laser Systems is intended for:
Removal of unwanted hair, for stable long term or permanent hair reduction
and for treatment of PFB. The lasers are indicted on all skin types Fitzpatrick
I-VI including tanned skin.
Photocoagulation and hemostasis of pigmented and vascular lesions. such as
but not limited to port wine stains, hemoangioma, warts, telangiectasia,
rosacea, Venus lake leg veins and spider veins
Coagulation and hemostasis of soft tissue.
Benign pigmented lesions such as, but not limited to, lentigos (age spots), solar
lentigos (sun spots), cafe au lait macules, seborrheic keratoses, nevi, chloasma,
verrucae, skin tags, keratoses, tattoos (significant reduction in the intensity of
black and/or blue-black tattoos) and plaques. The laser is indicated for
pigmented lesions to reduce lesion size, for patients with lesions that would
potentially benefit from aggressive treatment, and for patients with
lesions that have not responded to other laser treatments. The laser is
also indicated for the reduction of red pigmentation in hypertrophic and keloid
scars where vascularity is an integral part of the scar.
Treatment of wrinkles
VI. Rationale for Substantial Equivalence
The Candela GentleYAG Family of Laser Systems shares the same indications
for use, operating principles, mechanism of action, technological features as
the predicate devices and therefore is substantially equivalent to the
predicate devices.
VII. Safety and Effectiveness Information
The Candela GentleYAG Laser Family of Laser Systems is equivalent to the
Candela GentleYAG (aka Candela Long Pulse Nd: YAG Laser) cleared under
K010104, K022923,K02295 1,K023193 the Lyra I (K020021,K003765,
K003147) and the Altus CoolGlide Family of Lasers (K023954,
K010834,K003765) in technological features, and equivalent in intended use
and therefore the risks and benefits are comparable to the predicate devices.
Candela Certifies that this device is in compliance with the laser performance
standards required as per 21 CFR 1000.1040. The device conforms to the UL
2601 Electrical Safety Standard and with the Harmonized Standard EN 606011-2, Part 2 established by the European Community. We therefore believe
that there are no new questions of safety or effectiveness raised by the
introduction of the GentleYAG Family of Laser Systems.
VII. Conclusion
It is the opinion of Candela Corporation that the GentleYAG Family of Laser
Systems is substantially equivalent to the predicate devices based on operating
principles mechanism of action, and for intended use.

Statement of Substantial Equivalence
The purpose of this 510(k) submission is to obtain clearance to market the Candela
Gentle YAG Family of Laser Systems.
The Candela GentleY AG Family of Laser Systems presented in this submission, is a
modification of the Candela GentleYAG Laser System a.k.a Candela Long Pulse
Nd: YAG previously cleared under K010104, K022951, K022923, K023193.
The modifications incorporate features of the currently marketed predicate devices,
including expanded pulse durations, pulse frequencies, spot sizes, energy and indications
for use. The Table of Comparative Features (included as Exhibit D) shows the features of
the devices, including their similarities.
As indicated in the table, the GentleYAG Famly of Laser Systems is equivalent to the
currently marketed predicate devices, the Laserscope Lyra I Nd: YAG Laser (cleared
under K020021, K0037565, K 0031747), and the Altus Cool Glide Family of Lasers
(cleared under K023954, K010834, K003765), based on operating principles, mechanism
of action, and shares similar functional features such as wavelength, pulse duration, pulse
frequency, energy, spot sizes, and indications for use. Therefore, we do not believe that
introduction of the modified GentleY AG Family of Laser Systems raises any new issues
of safety or effectiveness.
In conclusion, Candela believes that the GentleYAG family of Laser Systems is
substantially equivalent to the currently marketed predicate devices.

Dear Ms. Patrovic: ;
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food. Drug.
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
