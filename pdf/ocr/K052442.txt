moderate inflammatory acne vulgaris which includes pustular acne, in patients with
Fitzpatrick skin types I-VI, and mild to moderate psoriasis in patients with Fitzpatrick skin

as the cleared Skin Station except for the addition of a light unit assembly specifically for
the treatment of psoriasis in patients with Fitzpatrick skin types I - VI.
Substantial Equivalence
The Radiancy SkinStation, as modified, has the same intended use and very
similar indications for use, principles of operation and technological characteristics as the
cleared Radiancy SkinStation, and the Cooltouch Prima IPL system, Candela, Inc. CBeam dye laser, Lumenis, Inc., BClear™ lamp, CureLight, Ltd., MultiClear lamp and the
MSQ (“M2”) Ltd. Lovely il PL UVlamp. The new psoriasis indication for use is based
upon the indications for use for two already cleared predicate pulsed light device
systems PRIMA IPL and the Cutera, Inc. Cutera Optional Pulsed Light Hand Piece
(PRIMA is the predicate device for the cleared Cutera Optional Pulsed Light Hand Piece
Family (KO50047) [Attachment 4]. The minor differences between the Radiancy
SkinStation and the predicates do not raise new issues of safety and effectiveness.
Thus, the Radiancy SkinStation is substantially equivalent.

Dear Ms. Fourte:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class HI (PMA),
it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device
can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA
may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing
(21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801): good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of yout device to a lepaily
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your
device to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21 CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
