Predicate Devices a
Diego RF Powered Dissector & Drill System: K034004
Endius Bipolar Sheath: KO012488
XPS (MDS) StraightShot Microdebrider System: K973499
Intended Uses
The PK® Diego® System is intended for cutting, coagulation and removal of bone
and tissue in general ENT, Head & Neck, Otoneurologic and various spinal surgical
procedures. .
Product Description
The PK Diego System is identical to the device cleared under K034004. The system
includes the same power console, footswitch, reusable handpiece and various single
use, interchangeable burs and bipolar blades. The sole purpose of this submission is to
expand the existing indications to include various spinal surgical procedures.
Technological Characteristics and Substantial Equivalence
The PK Diego System utilizes features incorporated into the following legally
marketed predicate devices:
The PK Diego System utilizes the same bipolar electrosurgical energy to cut
and coagulate tissue as that used in the predicate Diego RF Dissector and Drill '
System cleared under K034004.
The PK Diego powered handpiece, burs and bipolar blades connect to the same
electrosurgical generator/console, as the predicate and currently marketed
Diego RF Dissector and Drill System cleared under K034004. The Diego
bipolar blades are dimensionally similar to the predicate XPS (MDS)
StraightShot Microdebrider System cleared under K973499, having similar
blade shaft and tip diameters.
Like the predicate XPS (MDS) StraightShot Microdebrider System (K973499)
and the predicate Endius Bipolar Sheath cleared under K012488, the proposed
PK Diego System includes an indication for various spinal surgical procedures.
The PK Diego System uses patient-contacting materials that are utilized in the
predicate devices, as well as other legally marketed devices manufactured by
Gyrus ACMI.

Continued... Technological Characteristics and Substantial Equivalence

The bipolar cutting and coagulation performance of the PK Diego System was

compared against the known tissue debrider performance characteristics of the

predicate XPS (MDS) StraightShot Microdebrider System and the tissue coagulation

performance of the predicate Endius Bipolar Sheath. Testing demonstrated that the

performance requirements were met, and that the PK Diego System exhibited

comparable performance characteristics to both predicates.

In summary, the PK Diego System is substantially equivalent to the predicate devices

and presents no new questions of safety or efficacy.

Dear Mr. Baillie:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications :
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate ,
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

Page 2 — Mr. Graham A.L. Baillie
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section $10(k) .
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
