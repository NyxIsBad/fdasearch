Keratome
Hansatome Bausch & Lomb K010260 April 27,2001
Microkeratome Surgical |
The materials, basic scientific concepts, and physical properties of the FemTec Laser
Microkeratome are similar to those of the Intralase Pulsion FS Laser Keratome (and
the indications for use are identical), and the indications for use for the FemTec Laser
Microkeratome are identical to those of the Hansatome Microkeratome.
4, DEVICE DESCRIPTION
The FemTec Laser Microkeratome is intended for use in the creation of a corneal flap
by producing short bursts of laser pulses, with each laser pulse having a duration on
the order of 500 to 1000 femtoseconds (“‘fs”, 10° seconds). Microscopic gas
bubbles, which form as a result of the laser induced optical breakdown (LIOB), are
created adjacent to each other at a pre-determined depth in the cornea. It is this
continuous layer of gas bubbles that create the lamellar corneal dissection plane just
like a mechanical microkeratome blade. The FemTec Laser Microkeratome creates a
flap under very low vacuum (250 mbar), and delivers the laser energy directly to the
stromal layer of the cornea through a disposable PMMA contact lens, referred to as
the Patient Interface (PI).

5. INDICATIONS FOR USE
The FemTec™ Laser Microkeratome is indicated for use in the creation of a corneal
flap in patients undergoing LASIK surgery or other treatment requiring initial
lamellar resection of the cornea

6. TECHNOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS
The 20/10 Perfect Vision FemTec™ Laser Microkeratome has technological
characteristics very similar to those of the Intralase Pulsion FS Laser Keratome. The
design, materials, and characteristics of the FemTec™ Laser Microkeratome are
similar to those of the Pulsion FS Laser Keratome. The differences between the
FemTec™ Laser Microkeratome and the Pulsion FS Laser Keratome are insignificant
and do not affect the safety or effectiveness of the device.

7, PERFORMANCE DATA SUMMARY
The FemTec™ Laser Microkeratome has been designed and will be tested to
applicable safety standards. In addition, the FemTec™ Laser Microkeratome was
found to perform equivalently to the Hansatome Microkeratome with respect to the
creation of a corneal flap in an ex vivo study.

8. CONCLUSIONS
20/10 Perfect Vision GmbH has demonstrated through its evaluation of the FemTec™
Laser Microkeratome that the device is equivalent to the predicate devices with
respect to intended use, technological characteristics, and safety and effectiveness.

Dear Ms. Patterson:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that DA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that DA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with al! the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
