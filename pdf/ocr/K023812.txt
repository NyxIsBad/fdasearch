Product Code: 79GEl
Legally Marketed Device: ERBE Disposable Patient Return Electrodes, 510(k)

Number: K972269
Device Description:
There are two models of the NESSY Q™ (Omega) Disposable Split Return Electrode.
One with a connecting cable (P/N: 20193-084) and the other (P/N: 20193-085) without
the cable {Note: A reusable patient return electrode cable submitted in a previous
ERBE 510(k) [K960569] is used with this plate/pad}. The cable of the P/N: 20193-084
is made of Polyvinylcholoride (PVC), Copper Wiring, and Polyethylene (PE) Foam. It is
flexible, 4 m (13.2 ft.) long, and has a standard connection for fitting into an ESU. The
pad portion of each is made of Siliconized Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET), Scantape
coated with Acrylic Adhesive, Aluminum, and Hydrogel. There is a protective film cover
to keep the pad from drying out prior to being used. The Return Electrode has a peel
off tab that makes handling it easier. The plate also is flexible and molds well to the
skin. The relatively round external shape and geometrical internal omega design (i.e.,
the equipotential ring) of the pad more uniformly distributes the High Frequency (HF)
current. This was demonstrated through thermographic testing. The design also
eliminates the need for orientating the pad to the operative site (i.e., there is no long
side of the pad). The hydrogel layer overlaps all the aluminum edges, which reduces
warming of the pad during use. The Patient Plate is suitable for use on children and
adults. The Electrodes are each packaged in an aluminum foil pouch with a 2-year
expiration date. Also, they are provided non-sterile and are disposable.

510K SUMMARY
KO Q 3g 1%
Prior to electorsurgery, the NESSY Q™ (Omega) Disposable Split Return Electrode is
placed on the patients skin. AORN (Association of Operating Room Nurses) guidelines
are to be followed for site selection, preparation of the site, etc.. The Patient Plate is
then attached via a connecting cable to an Electrosurgical Unit (ESU) or Generator.
When the ESU is activated, the pad safely returns (disperses) the HF current. If the
Generator has a safety monitoring system, the ESU measures the current going into
and exiting the pad. In this manner, the Generator monitors the HF current and alerts
the clinician to any differences.
Intended Use:
NESSY Q™ (Omega) Disposable Split Return Electrodes are intended for dispersing
and monitoring HF current in electrosurgical interventions.
Similarities and Differences of the Modified Device to the Current Device (Predicate
Comparison/Substantial Equivalence):
Similarities
The modified Split Return Electrodes have the same intended use, performance
expectations (i.e., safely dispersing/returning delivered HF current and, with the
previous split return models, monitoring the current), packaging, and associated labeling
as the predicate. As with the predicate, the Patient Plate/Pad comes with or without a
connecting cable. Also like the predicate, they are provided non-sterile with the same
expiration dating and are disposable.
Finally, the contract manufacturer for the Return Electrodes is the same (Leonhard Lang
GmbH).
Differences
The material changes in the modified Split. Return Electrode basically involve the pad’s
carrier being made of Scantape with Acrylic Adhesive (Note: The fabric in band aids.)
which molds better to the body and an improved Hydrogel (NH-02). The materials have
been found acceptable through biocompatibility testing. Tests were selected based
upon EN ISO 10993-1, “Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices’.
For the modified Electrode with a cable, the cord is 1 m (3.3 ft.) longer than the
predicate devices that have a cable [i.e., the predicate device cable is 3 m (10 ft.) long
in comparison to 4 m (13 ft.) for the modified product that has a cable]. The extra length
provides the clinician with a little more latitude in regards to the position of the patient
and equipment location.
The pad of the modified Split Return Electrodes, are designed with an equipotential ring.
The round/omega design of the conductive films distributes HF current more evenly. As
a result, only one size pad (i.e., contact surface) is needed. Also, due to the
symmetrical design of the plate, there is no long side. Therefore, no orientation of the
pad to the operative site is needed.

All the changes have been verified or validated in design control. Applicable sections
of AAMI/ANSI HF-18, “Electrosurgical Devices”; EN/IEC 60601-1, “Medical Electrical
Equipment, General Requirements for Safety; and EN/IEC 60601-2-2, "Medical
Electrical! Equipment, Particular Requirements for the Safety of High Frequency Surgical
Equipment” standards were applied and met for the modified Split Return Electrodes.
Conclusion:

The modified Split Return Electrodes have the same intended use and principles of
operation as the Split Return Electrodes in the previously cleared predicate device.
Technologically the modified electrode’s round/omega design of the pad’s conductive
films disperses HF current more evenly. As a result, the NESSY O™ (Omega)
Disposable Split Return Electrodes are as safe and effective then the predicate device.

Dear Mr. Tartal:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for
use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce
prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
