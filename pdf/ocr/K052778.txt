You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of

be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition. FDA may

CFR Part $07); labeling (21 CFR Part 801): good manufacturing practice requirements as set
