IV. Product Description
The Lumenis Quantum series of IPL/Nd:YAG systems are intense pulsed-light (IPL) and
Nd:YAG laser devices. Each Quantum system is comprised of three main components:
¢ A system console (including software and control electronics, key-operated power control
switch, power-on indicator, emergency shut-off knob and a remote interlock connector);
« Acontrol and display panel;
© One or more delivery handpiece(s), the Treatment Heads.
The Q-switched Nd:YAG Treatment Head for the Quantum series is a pulsed laser
operating at a wavelength of 1064 nanometers. It is an upgrade that can be installed on any
Quantum system.
The Q-switched Nd:YAG Laser Treatment Head is a hand held device comprised of the
laser head and optics, trigger circuit, safety components and cooling circuit. The Qswitched Nd:YAG Laser Treatment Head is connected to the Quantum console via an
umbilical cable and connector.

Vv. Indications for Use
The Q-switched Nd:YAG Laser Treatment Head for the Quantum series is intended for
use in the medical specialties of plastic surgery and dermatology for applications
requiring selective photothermolysis and photo-acoustic effects in target chromophores.
The Q-switched Nd:YAG Laser Treatment Head for the Quantum series is indicated for:
e Removal of dark tattoos
e Treatment of pigmented lesions
VI. _ Rationale for Substantial Equivalence
The Q-switched Nd:YAG Laser Treatment Head for the Quantum series shares the same
indications for use as the predicate MedLite C Q-switched Nd:YAG laser system
(K011677), the Q-Clear laser system (K033259) and the Q-YAG 5 / Clear Light
(K003460), in that the 1064 nm wavelength is indicated for:
. ¢ Removal of dark tattoos
e Treatment of pigmented lesions
The technical specifications of the Q-switched Nd:YAG Laser Treatment Head for the
Quantum series are similar or identical to those of the predicate MedLite C? Q-switched
Nd:YAG laser system (K011677), the Q-Clear laser system (K033259) and the Q-YAG
5 / Clear Light (K003460).
Therefore, the Q-switched Nd:YAG Laser Treatment Head for the Quantum series is
substantially equivalent to the predicate devices.
VII. Safety and Effectiveness Information
The Q-switched Nd:YAG Laser Treatment Head for the Quantum series shares the same
indications for use, same principle of operation, same wavelength, same or similar fluence
range and spot sizes as the predicate devices. A Clinical Evaluation Report demonstrated
the safety and effectiveness of the Q-switched Nd:YAG laser for the claimed indications
for use. The Q-switched Nd:YAG Laser Treatment Head for the Quantum series does not
raise new questions of safety and efficacy.
VIII. Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, the Q-switched Nd:YAG Laser Treatment Head for the Quantum
series was found to be substantially equivalent to the predicate MedLite C’ Q-switched
Nd:YAG laser system (KO11677), the Q-Clear laser system (K033259) and the Q-YAG
5 / Clear Light (K003460).

Dear Dr. Murari:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug.
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class IT (Special Controls) or class Hi (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the F: ederal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including. but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
“Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
