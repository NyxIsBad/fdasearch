Description of The Profile Multi-Platform System is a modular, multi-wavelength laser/light system.
Profile Multi-Platform The system uses scanning and focusing optics to deliver a pattern of thermal
System energy to the treatment site. The system consists of contro! console which houses the
power supply, cooling system, fiber optic delivery system and/or articulated arm
delivery system with handpiece and/or scanner.
Intended Use:
1064 nm Indications for Use:
Coagulation and hemostasis of benign vascular lesions such as, but not limited
to-telangiectasia and rosacea.
Removal of unwanted hair, for the stable long term, or permanent hair
reduction through selective targeting of melanin in hair follicles, and for
the treatment for pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB). The Profile 1064 Laser
Systems and Accessories are indicated for use on all skin types
(Fitzpatrick !-VI), including tanned skin.
The Profile 1064 Laser Systems and Accessories are indicated for the
treatment of facial wrinkles.
Incision/excision and cutting, vaporization, ablation,
coagulation/hemostasis of soft tissue in the performance of surgical
applications. All soft tissue is included, such as skin, cutaneous tissue,
subcutaneous tissue, striated and smooth tissue, muscle, cartilage
meniscus, mucous membrane, lymph vessels and nodes, organs and
glands. It is further indicated for laser assisted lipolysis.

1320 nm Indications for Use:
It is indicated for the treatment of fine lines and wrinkles. It is also
indicated for the treatment of back acne, atrophic acne scars and mild to
moderate inflammatory acne vulgaris.
Profile Multi-Platform System with fiber delivery is indicated for the treatment of
reflux of great and small saphenous veins associated with varicose veins and
varicosities, and for treatment of incompetence and reflux of superficial veins in
the lower extremity.
2940 nm Indications for Use:
Skin resurfacing and treatment of wrinkles.
Pulsed Light (300-1400 nm) Indications for Use:
The Profile Multi-Platform Systems and Accessories are indicated for
use in surgical, aesthetic and cosmetic applications requiring selective
photothermolysis (photocoagulation or coagulation) and hemostasis of
soft tissue in the medical specialties of general and plastic surgery and
dermatology.

It is intended for use for:

* The treatment of benign pigmented lesions including dyschromia,
hyperpigmentation, melasma, ephelides (freckles);

(515nm LP filter, 560nm LP filter)

¢ The treatment of benign cutaneous vascular lesions, including port
wine stains, hemangiomas, facial, truncal and leg telangiectasias,
rosacea, erythema of rosacea, angiomas and spider angiomas,
poikiloderma of Civatte, leg veins and venous malformations;

(560nm LP filter, 580nm LP filter)

¢ The removal of unwanted hair from all skin types, and to effect stable

fong-term, or permanent, hair reduction;
(590nm LP filter, 640nm LP filter, 685nm LP fitter)

¢ Treatment of facial wrinkles, treatment of fine lines and wrinkles; and
(590nm LP filter, 640nm LP filter, 695nm LP filter, 800nm LP fitter)

* Topical heating for the purpose of elevating tissue temperature for the
temporary relief of minor muscle and joint pain and stiffness, the
temporary relief of minor joint pain associated with arthritis, the
temporary increase in local circulation where applied, and the
relaxation of muscles. In addition, it may also help muscle spasms,
minor sprains and strains, and minor muscular back pain.

(800nm LP filter)

Technological The Profile Multi-Platform System shares the same indications for use, similar design

Characteristics features (including wavelength, laser/light medium and delivery systems, power
supply, cooling and contro! system), functional features (including power output,
repetition rate, energy, spot size and fluence), and is therefore substantially
equivalent to the above legally marketed predicate devices.

Safety and The indications for use are based upon the indications for use for predicate systems.

Effectiveness Technologically, the Profile Multi-Platform System is substantially equivalent to the
listed predicate devices. Therefore, the risks and benefits for the Profile Multi-Platform
System are comparable to the predicate devices.

Conclusion The Profile Multi-Platform System shares similar indications for use, design features,
and similar functional features as, and therefore is substantially equivalent to, the
currently marketed predicate devices.

Dear Mr. Patel:
This letter corrects our substantially equivalent letter of May 2, 2007.
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices,
good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be
found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
