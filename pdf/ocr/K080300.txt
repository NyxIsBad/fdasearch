IV. Product Description/Technological Characteristics
The Cutera CMMCD treatment consists a massage device and an infrared
light(optional)/RF device. Topical heating for the purpose of elevating tissue
temperature is derived from conducted RF energy/optional infrared light.
Mechanical manipulation is derived from a vacuum assisted massage with rollers.
The pneumatic/mechanical manipulation of the skin is sufficient to provide mild
transient erythema and produces a temporary improvement in the appearance of
cellulitic skin where applied.

V. Statement of Intended Use
The Cutera CMMCD optional infrared/RF device is indicated for the relief of minor
muscle aches and pains, relief of muscle spasms, temporary improvement in local
circulation. The Cutera CMMCD massage device is indicated for the temporary
improvement in the appearance of cellulite.
VI. Rationale for Substantial Equivalence
The Cutera CMMCD has the same or similar indications for use as the listed predicate
devices, and is also technologically substantially equivalent to the listed predicate devices.
There are no new questions of safety or effectiveness raised by the introduction of this
device. No clinical data was needed to prove substantial equivalence.
VII. Safety and Effectiveness Information
Technologically, the Cutera CMMCD is substantially equivalent to the listed predicate
devices. Therefore the risks and benefits for the Cutera CMMCD are comparable to the
predicate devices.
We therefore believe that there are no new questions of safety or effectiveness raised by
the introduction of this device.
VII Conclusion
The Cutera CMMCD was found to be substantially equivalent to currently marketed
Velasmooth/Velashape, Triactive, and LPG Endermologie devices. The Cutera CMMCD
shares similar indications for use, design features, and similar functional features as these
devices, and thus is substantially equivalent to the currently marketed predicate devices.

Dear Ms. Maynor:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, “Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
