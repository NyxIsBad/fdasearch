Laser (K000072) and Medilas™ D SkinPulse™ S (K003993).

This premarket notification requests clearance for the expanded Indications for
Use that will read as stated:

The Dornier Diode Laser family, Medilas™ D Fibertom Laser (“Medilas D”),
Medilas™ D = SkinPulse™ (“SkinPulse”) and Medilas D SkinPulse™ S
("SkinPulse S") are intended for use in the treatment of symptoms due to urinary
outflow obstruction secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men over
the age of 50 with prostates with median and/or lateral lobes ranging in total
volume from 28-85cc and for cutting, vaporization, ablation, and coagulation of
soft tissue in conjunction with endoscopic equipment (including laparoscopes,
hysteroscopes, bronchoscopes, gastroscopes, cystoscopes, and colonoscopes),
or in incision/excision, vaporization, ablation and coagulation of soft tissue in
contact or non-contact open surgery (with or without a handpiece). The
SkinPulse™ and SkinPulse™ S lasers are also for use for the treatment and/or
removal of vascular lesions (tumors) and for the removal of unwanted hair.

5. Description of Technological Characteristics and Substantial Equivalence
From a clinical perspective and comparing design specifications, the Dornier
Diode family lasers and the predicate device, Indigo 830e LaserOptic Treatment
System with Diffuser-Tip™ Fiberoptic are substantially equivalent.

An analysis of equivalence has been conducted according to the “510(k)
Substantial Equivalence Decision-Making Process” flowchart from the Blue Book
Memorandum #86-3 and included as an attachment to this notification. Based
on the technological characteristics and overall performance of the devices,
Dornier MedTech America, Inc. believes that no significant differences exist
between the Dornier diode lasers and the predicate device.

Dear Mr. Thomas:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for
use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce
prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good
manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class I] (Special Controls) or class 1] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be
found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish
further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Page 2 — Mr. Tim Thomas
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or
any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with
all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807);
labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as setforth in the quality
systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation
control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.Page 2 — Mr. Tim Thomas
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to
proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801 and
additionally 21 CFR Part 809.10 for in vitro diagnostic devices), please contact the Office of
