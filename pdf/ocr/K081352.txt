Description of The Profile Multi-Platform System is a modular, multi-wavelength laser/light system.
Profile Multi-Platform The system uses scanning and focusing optics to deliver a pattern of thermal
System energy to the treatment site. The system consists of control console which houses the
power supply, cooling system, fiber optic delivery system and/or articulated arm
delivery system with handpiece and/or scanner.
Intended Use: 755 nm Indications for Use:
The 755 nm Profile Multi-Platform System with its accessories is indicated for
stable long-term, or permanent hair reduction for all skin types (Fitzpatrick | - V1)
including tanned skin. It is also indicated for the treatment of vascular lesions,
benign pigmented lesions and wrinkles.
1320 nm Indications for Use:
The 1320nm Profile Multi-Platform System with its accessories is intended for the
surgical incision, excision, vaporization, ablation, and coagulation of soft tissue.
Soft tissue includes skin, cutaneous tissue, subcutaneous tissue, striated and
smooth tissue, muscle, cartilage meniscus, mucous membrane, lymph vessels
and nodes, organs and glands. The Profile 1320nm laser is further indicated for
laser assisted lipolysis.
2940 nm Indications for Use:
The 2940 nm Profile Multi-Platform System with Profractional handpiece and
delivery system is intended for use in dermatological procedures requiring skin
resurfacing and coagulation of soft tissue.

Technological The Profile Multi-Platform System shares the same indications for use, similar design

Characteristics features (including wavelength, laser/light medium and delivery systems, power
supply, cooling and contro! system), functional features (including power output,
repetition rate, energy, spot size and fluence), and is therefore substantially
equivalent to the above legally marketed predicate devices.

Safety and The indications for use are based upon the indications for use for predicate systems.

Effectiveness Technologically, the Profile Multi-Platform System is substantially equivalent to the
listed predicate devices. Therefore, the risks and benefits for the Profile Multi-Platform
System are comparable to the predicate devices.

Conclusion The Profile Multi-Platform System shares similar indications for use, design features,
and similar functional features as, and therefore is substantially equivalent to the
currently marketed predicate devices.

Dear Mr. Patel:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device'is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 ~
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to :
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance
