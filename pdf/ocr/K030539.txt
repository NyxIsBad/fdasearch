Trade Name: LaserSmile™
Common Name: Dental diode laser
Classification Name: Surgical laser instrument
Classification Code: 79 GEX
Equivalent Devices:
BioLase Technology, Inc. Waterlase®
BioLase Technology, Inc. Twilite™
Device Description:
The LaserSmile™ dental diode laser system may be used to perform several
dental applications. LaserSmile™ uses advanced laser technology to incise,
excise and ablate intraoral soft tissues and to activate a bleaching material for
whitening/bleaching teeth safely and effectively. A Gallium Aluminum
Arsenide (GaAlAs) solid state laser diode provides optical energy to oral soft
tissues and tooth bleaching compounds.
A flexible fiberoptic handpiece delivers the LaserSmile™ laser energy. A
visible light emitted from the handpiece distal end pinpoints the area of
treatment. The optical power output and pulse may be adjusted to specific
user requirements.

including:
Excisional and incisional biopsies
Exposure of unerupted teeth
Fibroma removal
Frenectomy
Frenotomy
Gingival troughing for crown impressions
Gingivectomy
Gingivoplasty
Gingival incision and excision
Hemostasis and coagulation

Laser Periodontal procedures, including:
Laser soft tissue curettage
Laser removal of diseased, infected, inflamed and necrosed soft tissue within
the periodontal pocket
Removal of highly inflamed edematous tissue affected by bacteria penetration
of the pocket lining and junctional epithelium
Sulcular debridement (removal of diseased, infected, inflamed and necrosed
soft tissue in the periodontal pocket to improve clinical indices including
gingival index, gingival bleeding index, probe depth, attachment loss and
tooth mobility.)
Tooth Whitening Indications:

Contraindications:
All clinical procedures performed with LaserSmile™ must be subjected to the
same clinical judgment and care as with traditional techniques. Patient risk
must always be considered and fully understood before clinical treatment.
The clinician must completely understand the patient's medical history prior to
treatment. Exercise caution for general medical conditions that might
contraindicate a local procedure. Such conditions may include allergy to local
or topical anesthetics, heart disease, lung disease, bleeding disorders, sleep
apnea or an immune system deficiency. Medical clearance from patient's
physician is advisable when doubt exists regarding treatment.
Patients with periodontal disease and/or exposed root surfaces are not
candidates for laser tooth bleaching/whitening. Also, patients with damaged or
fissured enamel are not candidates for Jaser bleaching/whitening.
Substantial] Equivalence:
There are no unique applications, indications, materials or specifications
presented herein. All the submitted indications for use retain the same
meaning as their equivalent indications cleared by the FDA in K991994
(Twilite™! original indications for use), and in K011041 (Waterlase®,
expanded indications for use).
Conclusion:
LaserSmile™ is substantially equivalent to dental products previously cleared
for marketing. LaserSmile™ performs the same indications for use through
the same mechanism as the other cleared devices. Evidence of equivalence has
been demonstrated through the following:

Dear Ms. Rizoiu:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class TI (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal! Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
