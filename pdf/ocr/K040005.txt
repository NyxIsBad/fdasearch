Rationale for Substantial The Profile 2000 and Profile 3000 Laser Systems and
Equivalence: Delivery Devices and Accessories share intended use,

indications for use, similar design features (including
wavelength, power supply, cooling and control system).
functional features (including power output, repetition rate

and pulse duration), and is therefore substantially
equivalent to above legaily marketed predicate devices

Safety and Effectiveness The indications for use are based upon the indications far

information use for predicate systems. Technologically, the Profile
2000 and Profile 3000 Laser Systems, and Delivery
Devices and Accessories are substantially equivalent to
the listed predicate devices. Therefore, the risks and
benefits for the Profile 2000 and Profile 3000 Laser
Systems, and Delivery Devices and Accessories are
comparable to the predicate devices.

Conclusion The Profile 2000 and Profile 3000 Laser Systems, and
Delivery Devices and Accessories, share similar
indications for use, design features, and similar functional
features as, and therefore are substantially equivalent to,
the currently marketed predicate surgical lasers, delivery
devices and accessories.

Dear Mr. Patel:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class IT (Special Controls) or class ITT (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part $20); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
“Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
