Predicate Devices °
Radiancy (Israel) Ltd. DeLight II Hair Removal System ‘
Intended Use / Indications for Use
The SpaTouch is intended for removal of unwanted hair by using a selective
photothermal treatment. The device is generally indicated for dermatological
use. The SpaTouch is specifically indicated for patient removal of unwanted
hair by using a selective photothermal treatment under the direction of a
physician, after training by a healthcare professional.
Technological Characteristics and Substantial Equivalence
The SpaTouch and its predicate device are intended for removal of unwanted
hair by using a selective photothermal treatment. The device is generally
indicated for dermatological use. The SpaTouch is specifically indicated for
patient removal of unwanted hair by using a selective photothermal treatment
under the direction of a physician, after training by a healthcare professional.
With the exception of contact switches added to the handpiece, the SpaTouch is
the exact same device as the previously cleared DeLight II device. The only
differences between the cleared DeLight Il and the SpaTouch are the addition of
the contact switches to the handpiece and the expanded indications for use.
Neither of these differences raises new issues of safety or effectiveness. Thus,
the SpaTouch can be found substantially equivalent.
Performance Data
Clinical data demonstrated that the device can be used safely and effectively
under the supervision of a health professional.

Dear Mr. Kahan:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and we have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the
indications for use stated in the enclosure) to devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to
May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have
been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
(Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices,
good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or.class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may

CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
