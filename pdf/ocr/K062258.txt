Legally Marketed Predicate Devices for Substantial Equivalence:

Odyssey 2.4G Diode Laser, Manufactured by Ivoclar Vivadent, Inc.

SiroLaser, Manufactured by Sirona Dental Systems, Gmbh

Rationale for Substantial Equivalence:

The aforementioned laser devices and their accompanying delivery systems share
similar indications for use in the oral environment, similar design features including
wavelength, operating controls, and laser delivery method. The devices share similar
methods of control systems, safety features, and performance monitoring. The devices
share similar performance specifications including power output and energy type.

Description of Submitted Device:

The Odyssey Navigator Diode Laser is a portable device for delivering laser
energy to surfaces within the oral cavity. This energy is generated by solid-state diodes,
which provide a consistent and reliable generation of laser energy at 810 + 20nm for a
maximum of 3 watts of energy output. The laser energy is delivered to the surgical site by
means of a proprietary optical fiber system, which allows for the safe transmission of laser
energy to the site without creating undue risk to the patient or operatory staff by errant or
collateral laser emissions. The device features some user definable settings, including a
switchable 650nm aiming beam, adjustable power output for both the working beam and
aiming beam, and continuous delivery or pulse delivery option.

The working end of the delivery fiber is a disposable single-use tip which is
attached to a metal autoclavable handpiece. This handpiece system is provided with the
device. The fiber tip attachment assembly is delivered sterilized in individual mylar
blister packages. Sterlization is accomplished by Irradiation.

The activation of the working beam diodes is completed by use of a foot-actuated
switch. .

Intended Uses of the Odyssey Navigator Diode Laser: The device is intended to be used
for a variety of surgical procedures on soft tissue within the oral cavity including:
Dental, oral, and soft tissue surgery including:

Sulcular debridement of diseased or fibrous tissue

Excision and biopsy

Gingivectomy and gingivoplasty

Lesion (tumor) removal

Fibroma removal

Tissue retraction (troughing)

Aphthous ulcers

Gingival hyperplasia (excision and recontour)

Crown Lengthening

Operculectomy

Frenectomy

Photocoagulation ;

Laser Periodontal procedures, including:

Laser soft tissue curettage

Laser removal of diseased, infected, inflamed and necrosed soft tissue within the

periodontal pocket

Removal of inflamed edematous tissue.

Technological Characteristics and Substantial Equivalence:

The Odyssey 2.4G uses solid state diodes to generate laser energy in the 810nm
range. This system uses a fiber delivery system to transmit laser energy to the surgical site.
The system also features a 650nm adjustable output aiming beam and features controls
that allow for adjusting the output of the working beam, and switching between a
continuous or pulsed-mode laser emission. The maximum output of the unit 5 watts.

The SiroLaser utilizes solid-state diode lasers to generate laser energy in the
980nm range. The power range is from 0.5 — 7.0 watts and operates in continuous or pulse
mode. The system utilizes an optical fiber to transmit laser energy from the control unit to
the work site. The distal end of the fiber is contained with a metal handpiece and
terminates in a disposable handpiece tip. The system features an LCD touchscreen to
access the controls and features of the system.

Performance Standards:

The Odyssey Navigator Diode Laser complies with the performance requirements
of 21 CFR 1040.10 and 1040.11, with permissible deviations relative to Laser Notice 50,
dated July 26, 2001. The device also complies with IEC 60601-1:1998+A1+A2, IEC
6060 1-2-22:1995, and IEC 60825-1:1993+A1+A2.

Conclusion

The Odyssey Navigator Diode Laser is substantially equivalent to the listed laser
surgical devices without raising any issues of safety or effectiveness. This device shares
similar intended uses, and similar functional and performance characteristics. The device
is designed to comply with relevant federal and international safety and performance
standards.

Dear Ms. Hartnett: 1
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for
use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce
prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good
manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply
with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part
807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the
quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product
radiation contro! provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
