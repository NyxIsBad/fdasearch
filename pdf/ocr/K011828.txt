Dear Mr. Cho:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) notification of intent to market the device referenced.
above and we have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use
stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce
prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act (Act). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls
provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual
registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against
misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III
(Premarket Approval), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations
affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 895.
A substantially equivalent determination assumes compliance with the Current Good
Manufacturing Practice requirements, as set forth in the Quality System Regulation (QS) for
Medical Devices: General regulation (21 CFR Part 820) and that, through periodic QS
inspections, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will verify such assumptions. Failure to
comply with the GMP regulation may result in regulatory action. In addition, FDA may publish
further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register. Please note: this
response to your premarket notification submission does not affect any obligation you might
have under sections 531 through 542 of the Act for devices under the Electronic Product
Radiation Control provisions, or other Federal laws or regulations.
