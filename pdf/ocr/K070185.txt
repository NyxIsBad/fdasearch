intelligence designed to offer solid state light source treatments for mild to
moderate inflammatory acne.

7. Comparison of Technological Differences:
The intended use and technological characteristics of the Tanda Skincare

influence on safety or effectiveness of the Tanda product.

8. Additional Safety Data:
The Tanda Skincare System has undergone certification to IEC 60601-1.

10993 (Biocompatibility) and IEC 60825-1 (Laser Safety). The later
demonstrated an Accessible Emission Limit (AEL) below the AEL Class I
threshold.
The ocular hazard level presented by unprotected exposure to the Tanda
Skincare light source was determine by applying the calculations specified
in Threshold Limit Values for Chemical Substances and Physical Agents &
Biological Exposure Indices of the American Conference of Governmental
Industrial Hygienists Worldwide and the standards of the International
Commission on Non-ionizing Radiation Protection. The results indicated
that the Tanda Skincare System - did not pose a risk of retinal injury due
to either the blue-light phototoxic effect, or the thermal damage
mechanism. In addition, there were no additive effects from light
exposure.

Dear Mr. Cuscuna:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
Tf your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
