Description of the SLT Venous FDS products include the Venous Diffusing Fiber, the Venous

Device: Conical Fiber, and the Venous Flat Fiber.

SLT Venous Diffuser Fibers are flexible fibers with an active diffusing
portion that diffuses the laser energy in a uniform pattern about its active
diffusing length, resulting in a cylindrical or elongated spheroidal zone of
coagulation.

SLT Venous Conical Fibers splay the laser energy radially at their distally
conical portion, providing a much smaller and more focused coagulation
zone than the Venous Diffuser Fiber.

SLT Venous Flat Fibers direct the laser energy forward from their distally
flat end, providing the highest energy density of the three SLT Venous
Fibers.

SLT Venous Fibers are available with SLT proprietary connectors (to fit :
SLT Contact Laser ™ Systems) and SMA-905 connectors (to fit lasers with
standard SMA-905 launch interfaces).

SLT Venous Diffuser Fibers are compatible for use only with lasers having
wavelengths between 980nm and 1064nm.

SLT Venous Conical and Flat Fibers are compatible for use with lasers
having wavelengths between 810nm and 1064nm.

SLT Venous Fibers are flexible and therefore, when used for endovascular
applications, a catheter, cannula, or similar device should be used to insert
the fiber into the vein.

SLT Venous Fiber products are sold sterile, and are intended for single use
only.

Indications for Use: The SLT Venous Fiber is intended for use in endovascular coagulation of
the greater saphenous vein of the thigh in patients with superficial vein
reflux.

Substantial The intended use, method of tissue interaction, specifications, clinical

Equivalence: technique and animal study results of the SLT Venous Conical and Flat
Fiber Delivery Systems are the same or very similar to those of the legally
marketed fiber delivery system in the Diomed 810 Surgical Lasers and
EVLT™ Procedure Kit (K012398), to the legally marketed Ceralas D10-60
810nm Diode Laser System and ELVS Procedure Kit (K020835), and to the
legally marketed Ceralas D Diode 980nm Laser System (K013691).

The intended use, method of tissue interaction (thermal), clinical technique
and animal study results of the SLT Venous Diffuser Fiber Delivery System
is the same or very similar to those of the legally marketed VNUS®
Closure™ System (K003092, K982816, K974521).

The intended use, method of tissue interaction (thermal), clinical technique
and animal study results of the SLT Venous Flat Fiber Delivery System is
the same or very similar to those of the legally marketed Ceralas D Diode
980nm Laser System (K013691).

Safety and Animal studies have demonstrated the substantially equivalent safe and

Effectiveness: effective performance of the SLT Venous Conical and Flat Fiber Delivery
Systems with the legally marketed fiber delivery system in the Diomed 810
Surgical Lasers and EVLT™ Procedure Kit (K012398) to the legally
marketed Ceralas D10-60 810nm Diode Laser System and ELVS Procedure
Kit (K020835), and to the legally marketed Ceralas D Diode 980nm Laser
System (K013691). :
Animal studies have demonstrated the substantially equivalent safe and
effective performance of the SLT Venous Flat Fiber Delivery System with
the legally marketed VNUS® Closure™ System (K003092, K982816,
K974521).

The intended use, method of tissue interaction (thermal), clinical technique
and animal study results of the SLT Venous Flat Fiber Delivery System is
the same or very similar to those of the legally marketed legally marketed
Ceralas D Diode 980nm Laser System (K013691).

The materials used in the SLT Venous Fiber Delivery Systems are
biocompatible.

Toxological testing and evaluation per both USP Class VI and ISO 10993-1,
including hemocompatibility testing per ISO 10993-4, were successfully
performed.

Conclusion: Based on the foregoing, Surgical Laser Technologies, Inc., believes that the
SLT Venous Fiber Delivery Systems are substantially equivalent to and as
safe and effective as the legally marketed fiber delivery system in the
Diomed 810 Surgical Lasers and EVLT™ Procedure Kit (K012398), the
legally marketed VNUS® Closure™ System (K003092, K982816,
K974521), the legally marketed Ceralas D10-60 810nm Diode Laser System
and ELVS Procedure Kit (K020835), and the Ceralas D Diode 980nm Laser
System (K013691).

Dear Mr. Woodward:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing

(21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation contro] provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). Other general
information on your responsibilities under the Act may be obtained from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
