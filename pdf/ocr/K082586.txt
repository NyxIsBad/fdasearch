Common Name: laser instrument, surgical powered,
infrared lamp
Regulation: 878.4810, 890.5500
Product Code: GEX, ILY .
3. Predicate Devices Photo Therapeutics Ltd. KO30883, Omnilux Revive (K030426), Omnilux
Plus (K043317), Omnilux Revive and Plus Combination (K050216).
4. Device Description
The LIGHTWAVE™ Professional Deluxe System uses high-end Light
Emitting Diodes (LED’s) to distribute the specific wavelengths of light it
uses. This technology is commonly referred to as Photobiostimulation,
Light Emitting Diode Therapy (LEDT), LLLT, or LED's. The application of
LED's to tissue is non-invasive. :

These devices are solid state and hand free mounted for placement

directly over the skin where the treatment is to occur. |

The LIGHTWAVE Professional Deluxe LED system is a combination of

two sources of high chromatic accuracy. They provide uniform even

coverage exposure area. The output wavelengths of LIGHTWAVE

Professional Deluxe Range from 630 nm (visible red) to 830nm (near

infrared). The LIGHTWAVE Professional Deluxe base unit contains the

power supplies and the control unit. The LED panel can be configured to

contain one (1), two (2) or three (3) row(s) of LED (600, 1200 or 1800 ‘

LEDs respectively) based on system configuration. The LED panel is

attached to the end of the arms and then positioned for patient treatment.

The control unit consists of an LCD and keyboard together with the control

electronics. The user interface software allows the operator to access and

control all device functions. :
5. Indications for use

The LIGHTWAVE Deluxe Red light is indicated for use in dermatology for

treatment of superficial, benign vascular, and pigmented lesions.

: The LIGHTWAVE Deluxe Red and Blue light combination is intended to
emit energy in the red and blue region of the spectrum to treat
dermatological conditions, specifically indicated to treat mild to moderate
acne vulgaris.

THE LIGHTWAVE Deluxe Blue light is generally indicated to treat
dermatological conditions and specifically indicated to treat moderate
inflammatory acne vulgaris.
THE LIGHTWAVE Deluxe Red and Blue light combination is intended to
emit energy in the red and infra-red region of the spectrum for use in ,
dermatology for the treatment of periorbital wrinkles.
THE LIGHTWAVE Deluxe Infrared Light is intended to emit energy in the
IR spectrum to provide topical heating for the purpose of elevating tissue
temperature; for the temporary relief of minor muscle and joint pain,
arthritis and muscle spasm; relieving stiffness; promoting the relaxation of
muscle tissue; and to temporarily increase local blood circulation where
applied. ‘

6. Performance Data
.Based upon an analysis of the overall performance characteristics for the
device, LIGHTWAVE Technology believes that no significant differences

exist between the LIGHTWAVE Professional Deluxe and the predicate
devices listed above made by Photo Therapeutics.
7. Comparison to Predicate Devices:
The intended use and major performance parameters (energy
: transmission levels and wavelength) of the LIGHTWAVE Professional
Deluxe are similar or equivalent to the same characteristics of the Photo
Therapeutics Omnilux devices.
8. Testing .
Formal clinical trials were not deemed necessary as the device is using ;
the same technology and intended use as the predicate devices.
Testing information demonstrating safety and effectiveness of the
LIGHTWAVE Professional Deluxe in the intended environment of use is supported by testing that was conducted in accordance with the following
standards: IEC 60601-1 and IEC 60601-1-2:2001.
10. Conclusions —
Based upon an analysis of the overall characteristics for the device in
. comparison to the predicates, LIGHTWAVE Technologies concludes that
the LIGHTWAVE Professional Deluxe is substantially equivalent.

Dear Ms. Griffin: .
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration. : ;
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device canbe
found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
: or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
_ comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21

CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); medical device reporting (reporting of medical
device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

. If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
