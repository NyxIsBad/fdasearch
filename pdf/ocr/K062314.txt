SECTION 5. 510(k) SUMMARY
INTENDED USE
The Horus Laser Keratome is indicated for use in the creation of a corneal flap in patients
undergoing LASIK surgery or other treatment requiring initial lamellar resection of the
cornea.
DEVICE DESCRIPTION
The Horus Laser Keratome is a precision ophthalmic surgical laser designed for use in
performing lamellar corneal resections. The cutting action of the Horus Laser Keratome
is achieved through precise individual mirco-photodisruptions of tissue, created by tightly
focused ultrashort pulses which are delivered through a disposable applanation lens while
fixating the eye under very low vaccum.
SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE
The Horus Laser Keratome has technological characteristics very similar to those of the
IntraLase FS Laser, the laser predicate device, while the indication for use and the
intended use are identical to those of the Hansatome Microkeratome.
SUMMARY
The Horus Laser Keratome has been designed and tested to applicable safety standards.
In addition, the Horus Laser Keratome was found to perform equivalently to the predicate
device, the Hansatome Microkeratome, with respect to the creation of cornea resections
in extensive ex-vivo studies.
A statement of substantially equivalence to another product is required by 21 CFR
807.87 and relates only to whether the present product can be marketed without
prior reclassification or clinical approval. The present submission is therefore not
related to the coverage of any patent and is not to be interpreted as an admission or
used as evidence in a patent infringement lawsuit. As the commissioner of the FDA
stated: "A determination of substantial equivalence under the Federal Food, Drug
and Cosmetic Act related to the fact that the product can be lawfully marketed
without pre-market approval or reclassification. The determination is not intended
to have any bearing whatsoever on the resolution of patent infringement suits." 42
Federal Register 42, 50 et seq. (1977).

Dear Mr. Jones:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class I (Special Controls) or class I! (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 :
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
