Contact Person: Yosef Krespi, M.D.

Date Prepared: February 4, 2008

Device Trade Name: Fox 940 Laser

Device Common Name: Diode Laser

Classification Name: Laser Surgical Instrument

Predicate Devices: Fox 810 (K062619), LaserPro (K040924)

Device Description: Fox 940 is a diode laser with 940 nM wavelength and
maximum 5 watt power output.

Intended Use: Surgical applications requiring the ablation, vaporization,
excision, incision, hemostasis, or coagulation of soft
tissues in medical specialties including dermatology,
gastroenterology, general surgery, genitourinary,
gynecology, neurosurgery, otolaryngology, orthopedics,
ophthalmology, pulmonology, and thoracic surgery.

Device Technological The Fox 940 uses diodes to generate energy in the 940

Characteristics and nm range. Fibers deliver energy to the tissue. The Fox

Comparison to Predicate 810 Laser is the same system, but generates energy in

Device(s): the 810 nm range. The LaserPro is also a diode laser
producing energy in the 940 nm range.

Performance Standards: The Fox 940 Laser complies with the performance
requirements of 21CFR 1040.10 and 1040.11, with
permissible deviations defined in Laser Notice 50, dated
July 26, 2001. The diode laser also complies with IEC
60601-1:1998 including amendment 1, IEC 60601-222:1995, and IEC 60825-1:1993 including amendments
1 and 2.

Conclusion: The Fox 940 Laser is substantially equivalent to the
predicate devices. It has similar intended uses and
complies with the same safety and performance
standards.

Dear Ms. Paulson:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0120. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance
