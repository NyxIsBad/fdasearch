Proprietary Name: OmniGuide Zero Flow ZF-T Waveguide Fiber
Common Name: CO, Laser Powered Surgical Instrument
Classification: 878.4810
Product Code: GEX
Classification Name: Laser surgical instrument for use in general and plastic
surgery and in dermatology. :
Substantial Equivalence Claimed To:
K063141, OmniGuide ZeroFlow ZF-T 150 WaveGuide Fiber
K992472, SureGuide CO2 Laser Beam Delivery System
Page 8

Description:
The OmniGuide Zero Flow ZF-T WaveGuide fiber is an accessory for CO2 laser systems.
It consists of a fiber assembly that propagates CO, laser beams and vents the cooling
gases outside of the body. The OmniGuide ZF-T wave guide fiber is supplied sterile and
is intended for single procedure use.
Intended Use:
The OmniGuide Zero Flow ZF-T WaveGuide Fiber is indicated for the incision, excision,
ablation, vaporization and coagulation of body soft tissues including intra-oral tissues. It
is indicated in the medical specialties of general and plastic surgery, oral/maxillofacial
surgery, dentistry, dermatology, gynecology, otorhinolaryngology, gastroenterology,
neurosurgery, urology, and pulmonology, and can be used in open surgical procedures as
well as endoscopic minimally invasive procedures in conjunction with rigid or flexible
endoscopes, such as in laryngoscopy, gastroscopy, colonoscopy, laparoscopy,
thoracoscopy, hysteroscopy and bronchoscopy.
The indications for use for which the delivery system is used for are dependent upon the
cleared indications for use of the laser system and those laser system accessories to which
it is attached.
Summary of Technological Characteristics:
The device consists of an optical fiber assembly. The main functional component of the
fiber assembly is a photonic bandgap reflector lining its hollow core that reflects and
thereby guides CO) laser energy. The fiber incorporates a lens at the tip which is
transparent to the laser beam. The fiber also incorporates a sensor on the fiber tip that
allows physicians to determine when the lens becomes obstructed by debris. The fiber
assembly is | to 2 m long and transmits at the CO; laser emission wavelength of 10.6 pm.
Performance Data:
Non-clinical Performance Data: The OmniGuide Zero Flow ZF-T WaveGuide Fiber
performance characteristics have been evaluated through testing and analysis of laser
power output and beam quality. This type of testing complies with the respective section
of the FDA Guidance on the Content and Organization of a Premarket Notification for a
Medicat Laser (1995) and is similar to the predicate device tests. The performance of
OmniGuide Zero Flow ZF-T WaveGuide Fiber and related parameters of predicate
devices are comparable.
Clinical Performance Data: Formal clinical trials were not deemed necessary as the
device is using the similar technology and intended use as predicate devices.

Conclusions Drawn from Tests and Analysis:
The intended use and major performance parameters (energy transmission levels and
beam quality) of the OmniGuide Zero Flow ZF-T WaveGuide Fiber are similar or
equivalent to same characteristics of above mentioned legally marketed devices. The
evaluation and testing completed by OmniGuide did not raise any new issues of safety
and effectiveness.

Dated: January 4, 2007
Received: January 8, 2007
Dear Mr. Job:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
“Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
