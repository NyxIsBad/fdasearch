510(k) SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS SUMMARY
Trade Name: Aaron Reusable Electrosurgical Electrode
Common Name: Electrosurgical Electrode
Classification Name: Electrosurgical Cutting and Coagulation Devices and
Accessories (per 21CFR 878.4400)
Aaron Reusable Electrosurgical Electrodes are non-sterile, reusable electrosurgical
electrodes are used in conjunction with an electrosurgical handpiece and generator to
deliver RF energy used to cut and excise tissue or to coagulate blood vessels during
: surgery.
The Aaron Reusable Electrosurgical is substantially equivalent to Aaron
Electrosurgical Electrodes (K931338 and K942986) in operation, intended use, energy
source, and method of preparation. Performance claims for the reusable electrodes differ
from the predicate device in that they are not sold sterile and that they may be cleaned
and resterilized by steam under pressure. Aaron Reusable Electrosurgical Electrodes in
the loop configuration may be cleaned and sterilized up to 5 times. Aaron Reusable
Electrosurgical Electrodes in the blade, needle, and ball configurations may be cleaned
and sterilized up to 25 times. Cleaning and resterilization processes are validated in
accordance with Good Hospital Practice: Steam Sterilization and Sterility Assurance
(ANSI/AAMI ST46: 1993) and Designing, Testing, and Labeling Reusable Medical
Devices for Reprocessing in Healthcare Facilities: A Guide for Device Manufacturers
(AAMI TIR 12: 1994). The validated cleaning and sterilization processes are provided in
device labeling and instructions.
Testing performed on Aaron Reusable Electrosurgical Electrodes indicate that the
devices are substantially equivalent in method of operation, safety, and performance.
In conclusion, Aaron Reusable Electrosurgical Electrodes substantially equivalent to
predicate devices (Aaron Electrosurgical Electrodes) in methods of operation, intended
use, and results derived from operation.

Dear Mr. Kozloff:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other F ederal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
