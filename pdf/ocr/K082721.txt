4. DEVICE DESCRIPTION and DEVICE MODIFICATIONS
The PhotoMedex LaserPro 810, 940 and 980 Surgical Diode Laser Systems are
designed to provide laser power at wavelengths of 810nm, 940nm, and 980nm,
depending on model, which can be used for the procedures indicated in the next
section of this summary. These devices have been cleared previously via K 040294
and K042211. Differences between the cleared and modified device are limited to:

“ Addition of Laser Assisted Lipolysis to the indications of use of the LaserPro
980 Surgical Diode Laser Systems previously cleared via K040294 and
K042211.

«+ Addition of several other indications for use to the indications for use of the
LaserPro 810, 940 & 980 Surgical Diode Laser Systems previously cleared
via K040294 and K042211,

The system is comprised of the following main components:

e A laser console/cabinet with fiber port to accept SMA-905 connectors.

¢ Display panel with soft-touch keypad control and separate Emergency Off
button.

* Laser system microprocessor control electronics with operating software

e A detachable covered footswitch.

5. INDICATIONS FOR USE
The PhotoMedex LaserPro 810, 940 and 980 Surgical Diode Laser Systems, (and the
fiber delivery systems and accessories used to deliver laser energy), are indicated for
use in surgical applications requiring the hemostasis, ablation, vaporization, excision,
incision, and coagulation of soft tissue in medical specialties including: aesthetic
(dermatology and plastic surgery), gastroenterology, general surgery, genitourinary
surgery (urology), gynecology (GYN), neurosurgery, otolaryngology (ENT),
ophthalmology, arthroscopy, podiatry, pulmonology, and thoracic surgery; and Laser
Assisted Lipolysis (980 nm only).
The PhotoMedex LaserPro 810, 940 and 980 Surgical Diode Laser Systems, (and the
fiber delivery systems and accessories used to deliver laser energy), are indicated for
use in surgical applications requiring the ablation, vaporization, excision, incision,
and coagulation of soft tissue in medical specialtics including: orthopedics.

6. SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE
The PhotoMedex LaserPro 810, 940 and 980 Surgical Diode Laser Systems, when
used in conjunction with cleared delivery accessories, share the same indications for
use, similar design features, functional features, and therefore are substantially
equivalent to the predicate devices listed above.

7. SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS
The PhotoMedex LaserPro 810, 940 and 980 Surgical Diode Laser Systems are
designed, tested and manufactured in accordance with both mandatory and voluntary
Standards ensuring when used with marketed cleared delivery systems identified to
be compatible, they are considered both safe and effective for the medical
applications indicated. The addition of Laser Assisted Lipolysis and the several other
indications for use to the previously cleared indications do not raise new issues of
safety and effectiveness as the LaserPro 810, 940 and 980 Surgical Diode Laser
Systems are substantially equivalent to the predicate devices listed above which have
previously demonstrated their clinical effectiveness.

8. CONCLUSIONS
PhotoMedex believes that the (minor) modification to the LaserPro 810, 940 and 980
Surgical Diode Laser Systems are substantially equivalent to, and are safe and
effective as the legally marketed identified predicate devices listed above, in that they
share identical mechanisms for laser energy delivery and indications for use.

Regulatory Class: II .
Product Code: GEX
Dated: October 14, 2008
Received: October 16, 2008 :
Dear Mr. Intintoli:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications —
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register,
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050,
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474, For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
