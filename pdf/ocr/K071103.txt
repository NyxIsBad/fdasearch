Summary Prepared: April 10, 2006
Trade Name: Habib Hexablate
Common Name: Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation device and accessories
Classification: Class I! per 21 CFR 878.4400
Product Code: GEI
Predicate Devices: Habib 4X (K051420)
Intended Use:
The Habib Hexablate is intended to be used to assist in coagulation of tissue during
intraoperative surgical procedures.
Description:
The Habib Hexablate is a bipolar radiofrequency (RF) device that consists of a handle and an
array of seven parallel electrodes which extend out from the handle. The electrode configuration
consists of six electrodes in a ring and one electrode in the center of the ring. The Habib
Hexablate has an attached cable which connects the device to the Habib Hexablate Switch Unit
and then to an RF Generator. The electrodes are inserted into tissue and the tissue is coagulated
using RF power. The Habib Hexablate is designed for use in surgery and is a single use device.
Technological Differences:
The Habib Hexablate has the same basic technological characteristics as the Habib 4X. Both
devices use bipolar RF energy through a number of electrodes to create a volume of coagulated
tissue. The primary difference is in the size and shape of the coagulation zone created by each

device. The Habib Hexablate also uses aspiration through the center electrode to reérhove fluids
and gases from the center of the coagulation zone.
Performance Data:
Performance testing was done to ensure that the Habib Hexablate functions as intended and meets
design specifications. Sufficient data was obtained to show that the device is substantially equivalent
to the predicate device, and meets safety and effectiveness criteria.

Dear Mr. Christensen:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
