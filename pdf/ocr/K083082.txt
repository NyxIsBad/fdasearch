devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,

You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
; adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class IT (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it
, may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can .
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
