Date of Summary: March 14, 2006 Classification Name: Laser Instrument,
Surgical Powered
Common Name: Surgical Laser Instrument Proprietary Atrilaze™ Surgical
Ablation System
Description of Device: The Altrilaze Surgical Ablation System consists of a generator
designed for the delivery of 810nm or 1064nm laser light and a hand held fiber optic light
delivery device (probe) fitted with a standard SMA 905 connector at the proximal end. The
system may be used in conjunction with surgical treatment for hemostasis, incision, ablation,
coagulation and vaporization of tissue as required by the clinician.
Statement of Intended Use: The MedicalCV Atrilaze Surgical Ablation System is indicated
for the delivery of 810nm or 1064nm laser light to soft tissue to include cardiac tissue, during
surgical procedures. Indications include the incision, excision, dissection, vaporization, ablation
or coagulation of soft tissue.
Warning: The Atrilaze™ Surgical Ablation System is not indicated for the treatment of
cardiac arrhythmias.
The risk of actual damage to adjacent organs from the instrument exists and
perforation, rupture or tearing of tissue, may occur as a complication of laser use. Burns can
occur if the laser energy is not correctly applied. These complications may be serious.

Summary of S&E

Technological Comparison: The current Atrilaze Surgical Ablation System (K040744 &
K052495) consists of a standalone surgical laser emitting 810nm light and a disposable fiber optic
delivery system (probe). The fiber optic delivery system is coupled to the laser via an SMA 905
connector to deliver laser radiation to the targeted tissue. The proposed modification to the
currently marketed Atrilaze™ Surgical Ablation System is to provide the end-user with an
. alternate laser generator (wavelength) for ablating soft tissue by providing the end user the option
of using either a gallium aluminum arsenide (GaAlAs) semiconductor diode laser at a wavelength
of 810nm or a Neodymium-yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser at a wavelength of
1064nm. There is no change to the currently available fiber optic delivery systems (probes),
which are coupled to either laser via an SMA 905 connector to deliver laser radiation to the target
tissue. For purposes of this submission, the Nd:YAG laser (1064nm) used in conjunction with the
Atrilaze Surgical Ablation System was compared to the following predicate device:
© Medical CV Atrilaze™ Surgical Ablation System (K040744 & K052495)
Testing: The results of biocompatibility testing conducted on the disposable fiber optic
delivery systems (probes) contained in the original submissions (K040744 & K052495) support
that the materials used in the manufacture of the disposable probe are non-toxic, non-hemolytic,
and non-pyrogenic. All biocompatibility testing was conducted under Good Laboratory Practices
per 21 CFR Part 58. Since there has been no change to the design, packaging and/or sterilization
process for the disposable probe additional biocompatibility or sterilization testing was
determined not to be required.
Performance testing for the Atrilaze Surgical Ablation System utilizing the Nd:
YAG 1064nm laser included compliance to manufacturing specifications for Power Output, with
visual and histology evaluation of the lesions obtained using 1064nm wavelength on cardiac
tissue. Testing demonstrated that lesions obtained using the Nd:YAG laser at 1064nm wavelength
are substantially equivalent to those obtained with the currently cleared laser at 810nm
wavelength.

Dear Mr. Steger:
This letter corrects our substantially equivalent letter of April 11, 2006.
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices,
good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into cither class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA),
it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be
found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to continue marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your
device to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0120. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
