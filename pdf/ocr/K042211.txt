6. SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE
The PhotoMedex LaserPro 810. 940 and 980 Diode Laser Systems, when used in i
conjunction with cleared delivery accessories, share the same indications for use,
similar design features, functional features, and therefore are substantially equivalent

to the predicate devices which includes the Diomed D15 & D30 Laser Systems —- i
(K023543), the Premier Aurora Laser Systern (K954316), and the SLT Thermalite 810, 940 & 980 Laser Systems (K952661). ‘|

7. SAFETY AND EFECTIVENESS
The PhotoMedex LaserPro 810. 940 and 980 Diode Laser Systems are designed, !
tested and manufactured in accordance with both mandatory and voluntary Standardsi:
ensuring when used with marketed cleared delivery systems identified to be
compatible, they are considered both safe and effective for the medical applications |
indicated. No new clinical indications are to be provided by the introduction of |
: LaserPro Diode Surgical Lasers as compared to the identified predicates, which have|!
previously demonstrated clinical effectiveness. ;
8. CONCLUSIONS i
|
PhotoMedex believes that the (minor) modifications to the LaserPro 810. 940 and 980
Diode Laser Systems are substantially equivalent to, and are safe and effective as the}!
legally marketed identified predicate devices, the LaserPro 810, 940 and 980 Diode |
Laser Systems (K040294), in that they share identical mechanisms for laser energy i
delivery and indications for use.

Dear Mr. Rose:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class JI (Special Controls) or class [iI (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 53 1-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 - Mr. Robert Rose
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results ina classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
