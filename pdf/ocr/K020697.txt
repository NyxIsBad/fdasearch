Device Trade Name: DEPILASE TWIN YAG Laser System
Common Name: Long Pulsed Nd:YAG Surgical, Powered, Laser

E. Description
The DEPILASE TWIN YAG Laser System is based on Nd: YAG laser technology. Within
the system, an optical cavity contains the Nd: YAG crystal, which is activated by means of
the use of a flashlamp, with the option of frequency doubling the fundamental laser
wavelength, from 1064 nm to 532 nm. The frequency doubling wavelength is obtained by
passing with the laser radiation through a special crystal called Second Harmonic Crystal
(SHC). After the cavity, a red diode aiming beam is reflected onto a coaxial beam path using
a beamsplitter assembly. The combined therapeutic and aiming beams are guided down an
optical fibre delivery system to a focusing handpiece. The laser is used in a non-contact
mode. .
The DEPILASE TWIN YAG Laser System is designed with 5 major sub-systems:
a) A high voltage power supply which converts and rectifies the a.c. mains current to
provide regulated power for the flashlamp simmer current and main triggering pulse.
b) A cooling system consisting of an internal water flow circuit together with water to
air heat exchanger.
c) An Nd: YAG laser rod, capable of generating optical pulses at a frequency up to 3 Hz
d) An optical delivery system, interfacing the energy from the laser to the patient via an
optical fibre and focusing handpiece.
e) The microprocessor based controller which regulates the functions of the laser and
allows parameter selection by the user.

IL Intended Use K 6 f ?
The DEPILASE TWIN YAG Laser System is indicated for the coagulation and haemostasis of

; vascular lesions and/or the removal and permanent reduction of unwanted hair in Fitzpatrick skin
types I — VI, including suntanned skin types.
ILL Summary of Substantial Equivalence
Depilase believes that its DEPILASE TWIN YAG Laser System is substantially equivalent,
regarding the 1064 nm laser emission , to the Laserscope Lyra (K990718) and Altus Medical
Aesthetic CoolGlide (K991798) Nd: YAG lasers, previously cleared for both the coagulation and
haemostasis of vascular lesions and/or the removal and permanent reduction of unwanted hair in
Fitzpatrick skin types I — VI, including suntanned skin types, and regarding the 532 nm laser
emission to the Fotona Dualis KTP ( K011939) previously cleared for the coagulation and
haemostasis of vascular lesions
They therefore have the same Intended Use as the DEPILASE TWIN YAG Laser System. .
Technologically, the predicate devices have identical characteristics to the DEPILASE TWIN YAG
Laser System, all comprising a flashlamp pumped Nd: YAG laser rod generating light at a
wavelength of 1064nm or 532 nm, which is subsequently delivered to the patient via an optical fibre
delivery system and focusing handpiece.
The DEPILASE TWIN YAG Laser System output characteristics are very similar to those of
predicate devices.
All lasers are microprocessor controlled devices.
All lasers utilize Class I aiming beams which pose no hazard to the user.
All systems utilize an internal closed loop water-air heat exchange circuit for optimal thermal
control of the laser cavity.
The risk and benefits of the DEPILASE TWIN YAG Laser System are comparable to the predicate
devices when used for similar clinical applications.
It is therefore believed that there are no new questions of Safety or Effectiveness raised by the
introduction of this device.

Dear Ms. Gwynn:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 — Ms. Pamela Gwynn
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(K)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market. ‘
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801 and
additionally 21 CFR Part 809.10 for in vitro diagnostic devices), please contact the Office of
Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Additionally, for questions on the promotion and advertising of
your device, please contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4639. Also, please note the
regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97).
Other general information on your responsibilities under the Act may be obtained from the
Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number
