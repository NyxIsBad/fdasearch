Device Description
The Rhytec, inc. Portrait? PSR® System is an electro-surgical device for use in
dermatological applications. UHF energy from the generator converts nitrogen
gas into plasma within the Handpiece. The plasma emerges from the Nozzie at
the distal end of the Handpiece and is directed onto the skin to be treated. Rapid
heating of the skin occurs as the excited gas gives up energy to the skin.
Through the combination within the Handpiece of precisely controlled energy and
Nitrogen gas, individual plasma pulses are produced that will give predictable

tissue effects. The detachable Nozzle Stand-off (distance gauge) assists the
user in maintaining the proper distance between the Nozzle and the skin.
The modification is a reusable/disposable Standoff distance gauge accessory to
the Portrait® PSR® system.
Indications for Use Statement
The Portrai® PSR* System is intended for treatment of the following
dermatological conditions:

e¢ Treatment of wrinkles and rhytides

e Superficial skin lesions

* Actinic Keratosis

e Viral Papillomata

e Seborrhoeic Keratosis
The indications are unchanged from K071886.
Technological Characteristics
The Stand-off is provided in two sizes: 5 mm and 25 mm. Materials include Ultem
1000 and Accura® DuraForm™ PA Polyamide (nylon). It is used in place of the noncontacting LED targeting ring to establish the distance between the Nozzle and
the patient’s skin.
Substantial Equivalence Comparison
The Stand-off is equivalent to the current non-contacting optical (LED) targeting
system. It also provides the equivalent function of the distance gauges provided
with the Candela Gentle YAG Laser System.
Clinical and Non-Clinical Data
The Stand-off was bench tested to assure usability and function.

Dear Mr. Zoletti:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
