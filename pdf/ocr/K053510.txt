LinEMASTER”
AMERICA'S FOOT SWITCH LEADER
Proprietary Name:
IR Wireless Foot Switch
Predicate Devices:
The Linemaster infrared wireless footswitch is substantially equivalent in function
and intended use to the following legally marketed devices: Applied Surgical,
LLC, Gemini Surgical and Display System (K051831), Stryker wireless universal
footswitch (K033135), SurgASSIST system with wireless remote control
(K020343), Megadyne Mega power electrosurgical generator accessories
(K050579) and Valleylab force FXc accessories (K944602).
Device Description:
The Linemaster wireless foot switch will be an accessory to and provide foot
switch input control to any medical device that uses a foot switch to control on/off
inputs. The system includes a wireless foot switch and a receiver. The wireless
foot switches share the same transmission schemes, however each manufacturer
will have a unique identification code that is programmed into the transmitter and
receiver. This identification code will only allow communication of systems that
have been programmed with the same identification code. Systems from different
manufacturers will not communicate with each other.
When coupled with a system that uses a wired foot switch the wireless system
will function in the same way as the wired version. Apart from the software, the
technological characteristics are the same or similar to, those of the predicate
wired device where LED-based systems and infrared signals are used to operate
the device.
The elimination of wires on the floor of the operating room will improve the
safety and efficiency by uncluttering the OR floor and reducing set-up and cleanup time.
Performance Data:
The infrared wireless foot switch system meets the following standards:
¢ Classified to TEC/UL 60601.1 Medical electrical equipment by Underwriter’s
Laboratories, Inc with respect to fire, shock, and mechanical hazards in
accordance with IEC/UL 60601.1.
¢ Classified with respect to electric shock, fire, mechanical, and other specified
hazards only, in accordance with Can/CSA C22.2 No. 60601.1

The safety and effectiveness of the wireless footswitch described in this
submission has been demonstrated through risk analysis, verification, and
validation testing.
Indications for Use:
The Linemaster wireless foot switch will be an accessory to and provide foot
switch input control to any medical device that uses a switch closure (on/off), to
activate said device.
Warnings:
Plasma video displays can seriously affect the operation of infrared devices. The
plasma devices can increase switch activation times significantly or prevent the
switch operation altogether.
Do not use in the vicinity of plasma video displays.
Summary of Technological Characteristics:
The infrared wireless foot switch in this submission is similar with regard to
design, operation, and materials and intended use to the predicate devices
indicated above. Therefore, no new safety or efficacy issues are created and the
wireless foot switch is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.

Received: March 13, 2006
Dear Mr. Szostek:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class I] (Special Controls) or class IIT (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0120. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
