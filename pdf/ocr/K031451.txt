The XTRAC XL Plus Excimer Laser Phototherapy System is a complete self-contained
compact UV laser light source, which utilizes a XeCl gas mixture to generate dose-selected

The intended use is UVB phototherapy of targeted skin for treatment psoriasis, vitiligo,
atopic dermatitis and leukoderma.

currently approved indications for use, which the AL7000 has been previously cleared for.
The intended use for the PhotoMedex XTRAC XL Plus Excimer Laser System is within the
scope of the predicate device, the current market cleared PhotoMedex AL7000 excimer laser
phototherapy system. Both device types share the same methods and mechanisms to produce
targeted and controlled doses of UV light to affected target areas.
The XTRAC Excimer Laser System, model AL7000 is market cleared per 510(k) numbers
K992914, K003705, KO11382, & K020847 for the treatment of psoriasis, vitiligo, atopic
