Common, Classification and Proprietary Names
Common Name: Electrosurgical electrode
Classification names: Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation device and accessories (21 CFR section
878.4400) and Radio frequency cautery device (21 CFR section 886.4100)
Proprietary Name: Microsurgical Bipolar Handpiece
Predicate Devices
The NeoMedix MicroSurgical Bipolar Handpiece is similar in indications, design and features to the following
currently marketed devices: Bipolar probes by Medtronic (K010487), Kirwan (K962678), Xomed (K993655),
Oratec (K991218) and Mentor (K971538), Storz Bipolar Cautery Probe (K952151), Ethicon Bipolar Device
(K003587) and Wolf Multifunction Instrument (KO002000).
Indications for Use
The NeoMedix MicroSurgical Bipolar Handpiece is to be used in electrosurgical applications where low
power radio frequency current is applied through a bipolar probe for the purpose of cutting and coagulation of
soft tissues. The Handpiece is intended to be used in general and ophthalmic surgery where low impedance
or wet field conditions exist.
Device Description
The Handpiece is a sterile single use device that consists of a bipolar probe and channels for irrigation and
aspiration. These channels are connected to medical grade tubing with standard luer fittings. The
Handpiece is ABS plastic and incorporates a stainless steel probe designed to operate in the bipolar mode
when connected to any compatible bipolar electrosurgical generator capable of low energy output control.
The irrigation and aspiration sets provide for connection of the handpiece to irrigation and aspiration devices.

Microsurgical Bipolar Handpiece
Technological Characteristics Comparison
The probe is similar in design to currently marketed bipolar probes (Mentor, Kirwan, Storz) in that the
application of radio frequency current is bipolar in nature and occurs at the probe tip. The basic coaxial
electrode design has been modified to include a protective foot to shield underlying tissue from current flow.
This modification does not affect the safety or effectiveness of the device. A polyimide electrode insulation
material provides the electrical isolation between the active and return bipolar electrodes. The irrigation and
aspiration capabilities are similar to those in the Richard Wolf Multifunction Instrument. The bipolar electrical
connector pins are compatible with standard bipolar cables that connect to an electrosurgical radio frequency
generator, such as those used for the Storz, Mentor, Kirwan probes. The construction materials used have
an established history of safe use in similar medical devices.
Performance and Safety
The biological safety of the device has been demonstrated through biocompatibility studies of all patient
contact materials in accordance with the standards outlined in ISO 10993-1. Electrical safety has been
demonstrated by compliance to applicable requirements defined in IEC 60601-1 for leakage current and
ANSI/AAMI HF-18 for handpiece dielectric voltage. Physical testing was performed to assure connector
integrity, tip bend resistance and fluidic flow capability. The device is supplied sterile and sterility will
conform to a Steritity Assurance Level (SAL) of 10°. The supplied Instructions for Use provide the user with
the applicable warnings and cautions during use. There are no known contraindications. There are no new
safety or effectiveness issues related to this device.

Dated: February 7, 2003
Received: February 11, 2003 :
Dear Mr. Boonstra:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug.
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class IT (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements. including, but not limited to: registration and listing

(21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act), 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). Other general
information on your responsibilities under the Act may be obtained from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
