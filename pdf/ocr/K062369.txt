IV. Product Description
The OcuLight TX is a solid state laser that delivers true continuous wave green laser (532
nm) light for otolaryngologic, dermatology, and ophthalmic applications. The integrated
system is comprised of the OcuLight TX laser console, various compatible optical fiber
delivery devices, and a Footswitch. The laser console contains the laser head, imaging
optics, power supplies, control electronics, and firmware. The electronic system is
comprised of various sense and control electronics, user controls and displays, and an
embedded microprocessor that monitors all system functions. The microprocessor
interprets operator commands, formats displays and supervises laser emission. A visible
red (630-650 nm) semiconductor diode laser is used for aiming.
V. Indications for Use
The OcuLight TX is intended for use in otolaryngological, dermatological and ophthalmic
surgical procedures. In otolaryngology it is indicated for stapedectomy, stapedotomy,
myringotomy, lysis of adhesions, control of bleeding, removal of acoustic neuromas, and
soft tissue adhesion in micro/macro otologic procedures. In dermatology it is indicated for
the treatment of vascular and pigmented skin lesions. In ophthalmology it is indicated for
retinal photocoagulation, laser trabeculoplasty, iridotomy, and iridoplasty.

VI. Rationale for Substantial Equivalence
The OcuLight TX shares the same or similar indications for use, device operation, overall
technical and functional capabilities, and therefore is substantially equivalent to the
predicate devices.
Vil. Safety and Effectiveness Information
The review of the indications for use and technical characteristics provided demonstrates
that the OcuLight TX is substantially equivalent to the predicate devices.
Vili. Conclusion
The OcuLight TX was found to be substantially equivalent to the predicate devices.
The OcuLight TX shares the same or similar indications for use, similar design features,
and functional features with, and thus is substantially equivalent to, the predicate devices.

Dear Mr. Jossy:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
gencral controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class I (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
“Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
(240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/industry/support/index.html.
