Device Description:
Pajunks MIS-Instruments and HF-electrodes are used during minimal invasive surgery,
according to the professional surgeon and the instructions for use.
The Pajunk adaptable and retractable HF electrodes are multiple uses, non-sterile delivered and
latex free medical devices. They are intended for transient delivery of energy required for
coagulation of tissue.
The modular system for optional monopolar coagulation enables a surgeon to manipulate,
dissect, retrieve, biopsy, cut or coagulate internal tissue or organs while performing laparoscopic
procedures. The instruments are insulated for optional monopolar coagulation.
The Pajunk MIS-System contains but is not limited to HF-electrodes for comfortable and safe
coagulation with and without suction/ irrigation and microsurgical instruments with and without
suction/irrigation.
Pajunk provides electrodes with and without suction and irrigation element and electrodes with
suction and irrigation capacity with retractable/ extendable tips. Tubes for suction/irrigation are
available seperately also.
Pajunks electrodes consist of a stainless steel guidance rod, insulated tube, ceramic or
polyamide insulation at tip and stainless steel electrode tip for coagulation. Isolation at tip is
made by ceramic or poly amid and already cleared for market.
The electrodes are fixed to handle via click-screw, Luer or Pajunks M8x1 connector.
Pajunks electrode and instrument series are modular and interchangeable as stated in the user
instructions. Disposable inserts are also available.
Substantial equivalenve: basis for submission
The subject of Pajunks K011997 are Pajunks multipurpose handles (Modular vaive handles)
already designed for use with the HF Electrodes subject of this submission.
In K033249 FDA cleared HF Electrodes and instruments for either coagulation, grasping and
so on or suction/irriragtion (channel only). The subject of this PMN is the combination of both:
HF Electrodes within a suction/irrigation channel and optional retraction-extension.
There are no changes in material or technique in fact; the subject of this PMN Is a
combination of techniques already cleared In the predicates. Pajunks HF electrodes
subject of this PMN optionally are for suction/irrigation and coagulation at the same time with
the same electrode enabled by retraction-extension feature.
The electrode can be drawn back into the tube — re-tracted — for suction/irrigation procedures.
Afterwards it can be comfortably extended to go on coagulating (or whatever the surgical
intervention is intended to).
The combination of this two cleared technologies does increase safety and comfortability of the
procedure because it shortens the time period the surgical intervention takes place. Insttead of
employing two different instruments or an instrument inside a working channel The retractable
electrode combine both, suction/irrigation and surgical intervention.

Pajunk’s adaptable and retractable HF electrodes are substantially equivalent to Pajunk’'s oT
monopolar electrodes marketed under 510(k) number K033249. All materials, dimensions,
fixation specifications and intended use are identical. A retraction/extension feature has been
added.
Pajunk's monopolar adaptable and retractable HF electrodes are equivalent in design, physical
dimensions, metal and plastics materials, to Pajunks monopolar ceramic/ polyamid tip electrodes
marketed under 510(k) number K053282, K033249 and are intended to be used with Pajunks
Modular Valve handle system with different interchangeble fixation methods (click-screw, Luer,
M8x1) cleared for market under K011997.

Sterilization
Pajunks HF Electrodes are supplied non-sterile. They have to be sterilized before initial use and
before each further use. They can be sterilized up to five times (validation report in sect. 14 of
this submission).
Biocompatibility
Biocompatibility information for Pajunk's adaptable and retractable HF is located in Section 15.0
of this submission.
Indications for use
Pajunks HF Electrodes are instruments insulated for optional monopolar coagulation which
enable a surgeon to grasp, manipulate, dissect, retrieve, biopsy, cut or coagulate internal tissue
or organs while performing laparoscopic procedures.

Dear Mr. Quass:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments. or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug.
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration. listing of
. devices, good mantriucititing practice, iabentig, and prohibitions against misbranding and
‘ adulteration.
If your device is classified (see abeve) into either class II (Special Controls) or class HI] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations. Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
, contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,.
