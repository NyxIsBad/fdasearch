Technological Characteristics
The Ceralas D1950 is a diode laser operating at 1950nm with a maximum
power output of 50W.
Performance Data
Bench testing was performed to compare the vaporization, cutting, and
coagulation rates of the Ceralas D1950 and a 2010nm laser. The lasers were
directed at potato slices and porcine muscle tissue to evaluate vaporization,
and cutting and coagulation were evaluated with porcine liver, skin, and
muscle tissue. Similar parameters were employed with each laser to test the
effects of the Ceralas D1950 and the 2010nm lasers on the target tissue for
each of these tests. The testing demonstrated substantially equivalent
performance and tissue effects between the Ceralas D1950 and the 2010nm
laser device.
Substantial Equivalence

The Ceralas D1950 is as safe and effective as AllMed Revolix Laser Systems
(K033423, K051167, KO070476). The Ceralas D1950 has the same intended
uses and indications, and similar technological characteristics, and principles
of operation as its predicate devices. Thus, the Ceralas D1950 is
substantially equivalent.

Trade/Device Name: 50W Ceralas D 1950nm Diode Laser (Model D1950)
Regulation Number: 21 CFR 878.4810
Regulation Name: Laser surgical instrument for use in general and plastic surgery and
in dermatology
Regulatory Class: I

Dated: March 10, 2008
Received: March 10, 2008
Dear Mr. Kahan:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class IIT (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

Page 2 — Mr. Johnathan S. Kahan
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (2! CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance
at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address
