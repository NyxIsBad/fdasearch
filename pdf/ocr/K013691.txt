Name of Device and Name/Address of Sponsor
Ceralas D 980 nm Diode Laser System (Model D50)
biolitec, Inc.
515 Shaker Road
East Longmeadow, Massachusetts 01028
Classification Name
Surgical laser
Predicate Devices
Ceralas D Diode Laser System
VNUS Medical Technologies’ VNUS Closure System
DioMed, Inc.’s 810 nm Surgical Laser and EVLT Procedure Kit Laser
Intended Use/Indication for Use
The Ceralas D 980 nm Diode Lasers are intended for endovascular coagulation of
blood vessels. The Ceralas D 980 nm Diode Lasers are indicated for use in
endovascular coagulation of the greater saphenous vein of the thigh in patients with
superficial vein reflux.
Performance Data
The device complies with the following voluntary consensus standards: 21 C.F.R.
§§ 1040.10 & 1040.11; ANSI/AAMI ES1; IEC 60601-1; IEC 601-2-22; and EN 608251,
In addition, biolitec performed a single arm, open study at a single site with two
clinical investigators to determine the ability of the Ceralas D Laser System to treat

superficial vein reflux of the greater saphenous vein. Ninety-six percent of the
patients enrolled in the study achieved complete closure of the vein. All adverse
events were of limited duration and resolved completely.
Substantial Equivalence
The Varicose Vein Ceralas D has the same intended use and indications for use as
VNUS Medical Technologies’ VNUS Closure System and Diomed, Inc.’s 810 nm
Surgical Laser and EVLT Procedure Kit laser. In addition, the superficial vein
reflux Ceralas D is the exact same device as the cleared Ceralas D. Furthermore,
clinical data demonstrate that the superficial vein reflux Ceralas D is substantially
equivalent for endovascular coagulation of blood vessels in patients with superficial
vein reflux.

You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class I] (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
