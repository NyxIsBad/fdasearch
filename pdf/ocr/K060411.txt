Predicate Devices
Radiancy Acne System with ClearTouch™ Light Unit Assembly (K032205, KO51268)

Device Description .
The ClearTouch Lite™ is a pulsed-light, manually controlled system designed to deliver
light in a sequence of pulses to treat mild and moderate inflammatory acne.

Intended Use / Indications for Use
The ClearTouch Lite is intended to provide phototherapeutic light to the body. The
ClearTouch Lite is generally indicated to treat dermatological conditions. The
ClearTouch Lite is specifically indicated to treat mild and moderate inflammatory acne,
which includes pustular inflammatory acne in patients with Fitzpatrick skin types I-VI.

Technological Characteristics
The ClearTouch Lite that is the subject of this 510(k) notice is similar to the predicate
device already cleared to provide phototherapeutic light to the body, except that the
ClearTouch Lite xenon lamp emits lower energy intensity pulses compared to the
predicate device delivery of similar energy in a single pulse.

Substantial Equivalence
The Radiancy ClearTouch Lite Acne Clearance System has the same intended use and
the same indications for use, principles of operation and similar technical characteristics
as the Radiancy Acne System with ClearTouch Light Unit Assembly predicate, which has
already been cleared by FDA. The cleared Radiancy Acne System predicate and the
ClearTouch Lite are generally indicated to treat dermatological conditions. The
ClearTouch Lite and the Radiancy Acne System are specifically indicated to treat mild
and moderate inflammatory acne, which includes pustular inflammatory acne in patients
with Fitzpatrick skin types I-VI. The minor difference between the Radiancy ClearTouch
Lite delivery of a fixed sequence of lower intensity pulses and the predicate delivery of a
single pulse does not raise any new issues of safety and effectiveness. Thus, the
Radiancy ClearTouch Lite is substantially equivalent to the predicate.

Dear Ms. Fourte:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class Il] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must

comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CER Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as sct .
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation contro] provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
