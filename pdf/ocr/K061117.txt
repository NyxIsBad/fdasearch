Summary Preparation Date: May 17, 2006
Device Trade Name: Nanolite Skin Care System
Device usual name: Low level light therapy device
Device Classification:
Regulatory Class: Class II
Product Code: GEX
Classification Panels: General and Plastic Surgery
Regulation Number: 21 C.F.R. 878.4810 (Laser surgical instrument for
use in general and plastic surgery and in dermatology)
Note: The Nanolite Skin Care System is not a laser product; however,
the applicant believes that this classification is the most applicable.
Description of the Device:
The Nanolite Skin Care System is a light-based device that uses LED
to stimulate and regenerate skin cells. The device delivers red light at
640 nm.
The principal parts of the device are: the base that contains the power
supply; a LED module containing surface mount device chip LEDs;
one arm attached to the LED module to be positioned for patient
treatment; and a control unit consisting of an LCD panel with a touchscreen display.

The software in the LCD panel is preprogrammed to provide for
twenty minutes of exposure time to LED lights per treatment. During
each treatment, the lights are tumed on and off to prevent
desensitization of the skin area that is being treated and to increase the
stimulative effects of the energy from the LED.

The Nanolite Skin Care System generates output power equal to 170
mW/cm? from each LED. Since Nanolite has 6 LEDs per square
centimeter, it generates total power dissipation per square meter of
1020 mW/cm?. The device software is programmed to control the
output power to create a standard dose of approximately 90J/cm? for
each treatment.
Predicate Devices:
The Nanolite Skin Care System is substantially equivalent to Omnilux Revive
manufactured by Photo Therapeutics Limited (K03 0426).
Indications: .
The Nanolite Skin Care System is indicated to treat pigmented lesions.
Substantial Equivalence:
The Nanolite Skin Care System and the predicate device are all light devices
that use light emitting diodes to treat dermatological conditions by exposing
_ the surface of the skin to light at precise wavelengths. They have the same
intended use and general indications for use, are similarly designed, and have
similar principles of operation, performance and technological characteristics.
Although there are some differences in the technological characteristics of the
Nanolite Skin Care System and its predicate devices, those differences do not
raise new questions of safety or efficacy. Therefore, the Nanolite Skin Care
System is substantially equivalent.

Dear Mr. Lehtonen:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class I] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply
with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR
Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in
the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product
radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at 240-276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
