Date Summary Prepared: November 21, 2007
Device Trade Name: V-RASER Diode Laser System
Common Name: Dermatology Laser System
Classification Name: Instrument, surgical, powered, laser
79-GEX
Classification Code: 878.4810 Laser surgical instrument for use in general and
plastic surgery and in dermatology (1) A carbon dioxide
laser for use in general surgery and in dermatology is a
laser device intended to cut, destroy, or remove tissue by
light energy emitted by carbon dioxide.
(2) An argon laser for use in dermatology is a laser device
intended to destroy or coagulate tissue by light energy
emitted by argon.
Equivalent Device: Diodent Micro 980 (K063384), Iridex Varilite (K041930),
Device Description: The V-RASER Diode System is a modified Diodent Micro
980. It will use similar specifications (laser medium,
excitation method, fiber optic beam delivery, electrical
requirements, physical specifications) as the Diodent Micro
980. The laser source of this device is a solid-state Gallium
Aluminum Arsenide (GaAlAs) semiconductor diode. It
produces invisible laser energy at the 980-nanometer
wavelength. The delivery system consists of removable
flexible HCS (hard clad silica) optical treatment fiber

assembly connected to a lightweight, hand piece that has
two different size end pieces (tips) to adjust the laser beam
to specific spot sizes. Activation occurs when the operator
enables the laser by a key switch, enters the Ready Mode
and presses the footswitch. Releasing the footswitch
suspends laser treatment. A color LCD and touch-screen
display panel allows the operator to adjust or set the laser
output level. The laser operates in a pulsed mode and will
have a removable stainless steel end piece for establishing
the proper focal length for the treatment. The hand piece
will be manually attached (i.e., screwed on) to a connector
to the fiber assembly. The spot size will be selected on the
control panel and the software will calculate the treatment
fluence accordingly.
Intended Use: Incision, excision, ablation, vaporization and coagulation of
soft tissue. Indicated for the treatment of vascular lesions.
Comparison: The V-RASER Diode Laser System is comparable to its
predicate and parent device in terms of its indications for
use, technical specifications, operating performance
features, and general design features.

Trade/Device Name: V-RASER Diode Laser System
Regulation Number: 2] CFR 878.4810
Regulation Name: Laser surgical instrument for use in general and plastic surgery and

Regulatory Class: II
Product Code: GEX
Dated: November 21, 2007
Received: November 21, 2007
Dear Ms. Burns:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class IL (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance
at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address
