Description:
The Highland Beam Delivery System is the CO laser beam delivery system that can be
retrofitted to Luxar LX-20 or Lumenis NovaPuise CO) laser. It consists of a laser adapter
with a fiber cable and optical fiber handpiece that propagate CO laser beam, cooling
devices for fiber cable and movable cart that houses all system components.
The optical fiber handpiece consists of optical fiber integrated with a handpiece. It is
supplied sterile and is intended for single procedure use. The laser adapter and fiber cable
are re-usable devices that transmit CO. laser radiation from the laser to the fiber
assembly.
Intended Use:
The Highland Beam Delivery System is intended for the incision, excision, ablation,
vaporization and coagulation of body soft tissues including intraoral tissues
The indications for use for which the delivery system is used are dependent upon the
cleared indications for use of the laser system and those laser system accessories to which
it is attached.
Summary of Technological Characteristics:
The device consists of the optical fiber handpiece, the laser adapter with fiber cable for
connecting the fiber assembly to the laser and the unit regulating the amount of cooling
gas entering the fiber core and providing the liquid coolant for fiber cable cooling. The
system components are mounted on the movable cart. The main functional component of
the optical fiber handpiece and fiber cable is a photonic bandgap optical fiber. Its hollow
core contains highly reflective lining and it thereby guides CO2 laser energy. The optical
fiber handpiece and fiber cable connected together are about 2.1 m long and transmit at
the CO; laser emission wavelength of 10.6 pm. To maintain high transmission power
capacity and reliability of multiple use fiber cable, it is actively cooled by recirculated
liquid coolant supplied by recirculating chiller.
Performance Data:
Non-clinical Performance Data: The Highland Beam Delivery System performance
characteristics have been evaluated through bench testing and analysis of laser power
output and beam quality. This type of testing complies with the respective section of the
FDA Guidance on the Content and Organization of a Premarket Notification for a
Medical Laser (1995) and IEC 60601-1 and 2 and is similar to the predicate device tests.
The performance of the Highland Beam Delivery System and related parameters of
predicate devices (as specified in comparison table) are comparable. The materials of
optical fiber handpiece have passed biocompatibility testing as performed by an
independent laboratory in accordance with ISO 10993-1:2003 Standards.
Clinical Performance Data: Formal clinical trials were not deemed necessary as the :
device has the same core technology and intended use as predicate devices. The market
surveillance of previously cleared OmniGuide device (K050541) that is using the same
core fiber technology and has the same intended use and tissue interaction mechanism
indicated that the devices performed as intended.

Conclusions Drawn from Tests and Analysis:
The current version of the device does not present any differences in the delivery, quality
and / or control of laser beam and does not change the interaction between the laser beam
and human tissue. The only differences presented in this submission in comparison to
OmniGuide BeamPath CO, Mark I Laser Beam Delivery System previously cleared via
K050541 are improvements in the device reliability and convenience for use, introduced
by utilization of actively cooled fiber cable and better controlled cooling methods for
fiber.
The intended use and major performance parameters (energy transmission levels and
beam quality) of the Highland Beam Delivery System are similar or equivalent to same
characteristics of above mentioned legally marketed devices.

Trade/Device Name: Highland Beam Delivery System

Regulation Number: 21 CFR 878.4810

Regulation Name: Laser surgical instrument for use in general and plastic surgery and in

dermatology

Regulatory Class: II

Product Code: GEX

Dated: July 3, 2006

Received: July 6, 2006
Dear Mr. Job:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class Il] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and teus, permits your device
to proceed to the market. ,
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
“Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
(240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address http://www. fda.gov/cdrh/industry/support/index.html.
