Device Name .
Proprietary Name: Stryker Crossfire System SEP 2 0 2007
Common and Usual RF and Shaver System
Names:
Classification Name: Arthroscope (21 CFR 888.1100) and

Electrosurgical Cutting and Coagulation Device and Accessories (21

CFR 878.4400)
Product Description: The Stryker Crossfire System consists of a console, footswitch, shaver
handpiece and two possible disposable attachments (RF probe and shaver blade).
Indications for Use: The Stryker Crossfire System is intended for use in orthopedic and
arthroscopic procedures for the following joints: knee, shoulder, ankle, elbow, wrist, and hip.
The Crossfire System provides abrasion, resection, debridement and removal of bone and soft
tissue through its shaver blade; and the ablation and coagulation of soft tissue, as well as
hemostasis of blood vessels, through its electrosurgical probe. Examples of uses of the
product include resection of torn knee cartilage, subacromial decompression, and resection of
synovial tissue in other joints.
Contraindications: The electrosurgical probe should not be used in procedures where a
nonconductive irrigant is used or with patients having cardiac pacemakers or other electronic
implants.
Voluntary Safety and Performance Standards: The Stryker Crossfire System will conform
to the following voluntary safety and performance standards including: EN 980, EN 1041,
IEC 60601-1, IEC 60601-1-1, IEC 60601-1-2, SEC 60601-1-4, IEC 62304, IEC 60601-2-2,
IEC 60529, G 95-1, ISO 10993-1, EN 550, EN 556-1, ISO 17664, ISO 11607-1, ISO 11607-2
and ISO 14971.
Predicate Devices: The Stryker Crossfire System is substantially equivalent in terms of safety
and effectiveness to currently marketed devices including the Stryker CORE (K032303),
SERFAS Energy (K041810), and Total Performance Shaver (K973195) Systems.
Substantial Equivalence: When compared to the predicated devices listed above, the Stryker
Crossfire System has the same intended use and the technological differences do not raise new
questions of safety and effectiveness. Therefore, the Stryker Crossfire System is substantially
equivalent to the predicate marketed devices. Refer to Section 7.0 for a detailed comparison.

Dear Mr. Semone:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 - Mr. K. Jeffrey Semone
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
“Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
