efficacy, design specification, power source and performance criteria. The Tecno device
may differ from the predicates in color and size. However, these differences raise no
issues of safety or effectiveness.
8. Discussion of Non-Clinical Tests Performed for Determination of Substantial
Equivalence are as follows:
Testing was conducted in accordance with ANSI/AAMI HF 18-2001 and IEC
60601-2-2 (3 ed), Medical Electrical Equipment — Part 2-2: Particular
requirements of high frequency surgical instruments on Bipolar Cables. Test
results concluded that cable meets the requirement of safety and effectiveness
