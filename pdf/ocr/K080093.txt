Intended Uses
The Gyrus ACMI PKS Plasma Morcellator is intended for cutting, coring, and
extracting tissue in various operative laparoscopy procedures, including laparoscopic
general surgical procedures, laparoscopic urological procedures, and laparoscopic
gynecologic procedures:
Product Description
The Gyrus ACMI PKS Plasma Morcellator consists of two main elements: a
Morcellator that includes a cutting shaft and handle with an integrated electrical cable
that connects to a Gyrus Medical generator; and a Grasper that passes through the
hollow shaft of the Morcellator, to grasp tissue and retract it toward the cutting
element on the Morcellator shaft tip: An obturator may also be used to assist in the
introduction of the device in laparoscopic procedures, and like the grasper, is
positioned through the shaft of the Morcellator tube when being utilized
Technological Characteristics and Substantial Equivalence
The Gyrus ACMI PKS Plasma Morcellator utilizes features incorpotated-into the
following legally marketed predicate devices:
The Gyrus ACMI PKS Plasma Morcellator utilizes the same bipolar electrosurgical
energy to cut tissue as that used in the predicate Gyrus Medical Inc. PlasmaCision
Laparoscopic Spatula.
The Gyrus ACMI PKS Plasma Morcellator connects to the same electrosurgical
generators, the currently marketed Gyrus PlasmaKinetic SuperPulse System and
Gyrus General Purpose Electrosurgical System generators, as the predicate Gyrus
Medical Inc. PlasmaCision Laparoscopic Spatula: These generators were cleared.
under K031085 and K050550, respectivély.
The Gyrus ACMI PKS Plasma Morcellator is dimensionally similar to the predicate
Ethicon Gynecare Laparoscopic Morcellator, having similar Morcellator shaft
diameters.
Like the predicate Ethicon Gynecare Laparoscopic Morcellator, the Gyrus ACMI PKS
Plasma Morcellator utilizes a pistol grip Morcellator with a hollow shaft through
which a grasper.is passed to grasp tissue to be resected.

Like the predicate Ethicon Gynecare Laparoscopic Morcellator, the Gyrus ACMI PKS
Plasma Morcellator is indicated for cutting, coring, and extracting tissue in various
operative laparoscopy procedures, including laparoscopic general surgical procedures,
laparoscopic urological procedures, and laparoscopic gynecologic procedures.
The Gyrus ACMI PKS Plasma Morcellator uses patient-contacting materials that are
utilized in the predicate devices, as well as other legally marketed devices
manufactured by Gyrus ACMI.
During design verification, the performance of the PKS Plasma Morcellator was
compared against the known performance characteristics of the predicate Gynecare
Laparoscopic Morcellator using the bipolar tissue cutting technology of the predicate
Gyrus PlasmaCision Laparoscopic Spatula. Testing demonstrated that the
performance requirements were met, and that the PKS Plasma Morcellator exhibited
comparable performance characteristics to both the predicate care Laparoscopic
Morcellator and predicate Gyrus PlasmaCision Laparoscopic Spatula.
In summary, the Gyrus ACMI PKS Plasma Morcellator is substantially equivalent to
the predicate devices and presents no new questions of safety or efficacy.

and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
