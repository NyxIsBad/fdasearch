§10(k) Summary of Safety and Effectiveness — ARION Device
4. Device Description
The ARION is a 755 nm solid-state long-pulsed Alexandrite laser system.
The beam is directed to the treatment area by a transmission system which
is connected to the laser device. The EPI Zoom Ax transmission system
consists of a hand piece attachment with a firmly attached fiber and a hand
piece. The hand piece insert can be moved within the hand piece and
determine the application and parameter ranges. The hand piece insert in the
transmission system hand piece can snap into various positions. The number
located closest to the hand piece indicates the spot diameter on the skin in
mm (spot sizes: 6/8/10/12/14 mm). The integrated hand piece detection
feature automatically shows the selected spot diameter on the laser display.
The parameter range is also automatically adjusted for the corresponding
range. The MedArt 928 scanner for ARION consists of a scanner with a
connected transmission system and a spacer with a 8, 9, 10 and 12 mm spot
size. The spacer determines the spot diameter on the skin and therefore the
parameter range of the configurable energy densities as well. The spacers
are inserted into the scanner as shown below and must be inserted into the
scanner up to the limit stop position. The spacers now automatically sets a
spot diameter of 8, 9, 10, and 12 mm on the skin; this is also shown
automatically on the laser display. The parameter range is also automatically
adjusted for the corresponding range. For epidermal cooling can be a cooling
device adapted to the handpiece / scanner.
5. Indications for Use
The ARION laser system is indicated:
1. The ARION Alexandrite Laser is intended for use in dermatology for hair
removal for skin types Fitzpatrick | - IV.
6. Performance Data
None presented.

Dear Mr. Sammons:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class IT (Special Controls) or class IIT (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
