I. Trade Name: E Surgical Coated Electrode: OCT 24 2006

Electrode, Coated Ball

Electrode, Coated Blade

Electrode, Coated Needle
I. Common Name: Active Electrode
III. Classification: 21 CFR 878.4400, Class II, Electrosurgical Cutting and Coagulation Accessory
IV. Product Code: GE]
V. Indications for Use
E Surgical Coated Electrodes are intended as an alternative to uncoated stainless steel electrodes or
“non-stick” coated electrodes for use in conventional monopolar electrosurgical accessories. The
Coated Electrodes are intended for use in situations where monopolar electrosurgical cutting and
coagulation are normally used.
VI. Predicate Devices
a. Valleylab Edge™ Coated Electrodes, K962044
b. New Deantronics, Ltd. Disposable Hand Switching Pencil, K982742
VII. Device Description
The E Surgical coated electrodes are designed as a standard stainless steel active electrode with a nonstick coating to prevent tissue and char build-up on the electrode. Three models: ball, needle, and
blade are included.
VILI. Summary of Technological Characteristics
The active electrodes are substantially equivalent to the New Deantronic electrodes in the disposable
hand switching pencil, K982742, and the Valleylab Edge™ Coated Electrodes, K962044. The
electrodes are a modification to the single-use electrodes of various tip configurations. A proprietary
coating provides a non-stick surface for easier cleaning of eschar during use.
The electrodes are intended for use during monopolar electrosurgery. ‘Ihe electrodes fit in currently
marketed electrosurgical pencils offered by New Deantronics and other manufacturers.
IX. Safety and Performance Data .
a. Meets safety and performance requirements under ANSI/AAMI HF 18 Electrosurgical Devices.
b. Finished product non-stick coating was bent to 90 degrees ten times without visible cracking of the
coating.
c. Cutting or coagulation is initiated immediately at both lower and higher power settings.
d. Easy to clean properties after use on tissue.
e. Materials used in the construction of the electrodes meet ISO 10993 Biocompatibility requirements.

Dear Mr. Ward:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation contro! provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 — Mr. Lewis Ward
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
