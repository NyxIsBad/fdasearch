5. Device Description: , : ,
The Advanced Medical Innovations Disposable Trocars and
Laparoscopic Accessories can be used in a variety of procedures
(general, vascular, gynecological and surgical procedures) to cut,
dissect, manipulate and/or cauterize various tissues. Trocars are sterile,
single-use devices that allow visualization of body cavities and use of
. the laparoscopic accessories. :
The accessory devices are disposable, single use, individually packaged
‘ devices that are composed of biocompatible materials. Scissors, forceps,
and dissectors have a handle attached to an insulated shaft with different
tips, which allows the shaft and tip to rotate. They include a male cautery .
connector when attached to standard monopolar cautery cables and their
: generators. All devices are sterilized using a traditional, validated gamma
, procedure per AAMI/ISO International standard 11137 (EN 552) to a
SAL of 10-6.
6. Intended Use/Indications for Use
‘ The Advanced Medical Monopolar Scissors, Maryland Dissecting Forceps, Lap
Clinch, Rat Tooth LapClinch, Babcock, Straight Grasping Forceps with Ratchet
are indicated for use in gynecological and general endoscopic procedures for
mobilization and transection of tissues. The device with a 5mm diameter
insulated shaft has a male cautery connection on top of the handle and may be
. used for monopolar cautery when attached to standard cautery cables and their
., generators
. The Advanced Medical Reducer has application in gynecologic laparoscopy and
other abdominal procedures and is designed to be used with the Advanced /

ne a
Medical Disposable Surgical Trocar to allow the surgeon to insert undersized
- instruments through the Trocar without losing insufflation. :
The Advanced Medical Laparoscopic Smoke Filter is intended for the filtration of
contaminants from smoke, generated during laparoscopic surgery, which can
contain volatile organic products of combustion (including those which are
, perceived as odor) and particulates (including cellular debris, bacteria and
viruses). ,
The Advanced Medical Hasson Trocar and Dilating Tip Trocar has application in
thoracic, gynecologic laparoscopy, and other abdominal procedures to establish
a path of entry for endoscopic instruments.
The Advanced Medical Shielded Trocar has application in thoracic, gynecologic
laparoscopy, and other abdominal procedures to establish a path of entry for
endoscopic instruments. Instruments provided with a stopcock are intended for
insufflation of the operative space when the trocar is. in place. :
The Advanced Medical Secondary Trocar and Sleeve with Insufflation Port are
manual surgical instruments used to support a cut down (lap approach).
The Secondary Trocar is used in endoscopic surgery (abdominal and thoracic)
. for incision and peritoneal access for positioning of the hollow sleeve. Once the
trocar is removed, the port of entry provided by the sleeve, through the cap, is
used with manual surgical instruments, endoscopic instruments, laparoscopes .
and probes. There is a seal on the cap which closes the port of entry.
The Advanced Medical Stainless Steel Veress Needle is for the initial induction
: of pneumoperitoneum.
The Advanced Medical Suction/Irrigation Set is intended for use in endoscopic
: procedures such as laparoscopy, pelviscopy, and thorascopy, for suctioning of
large clots, retrieving spilled stones, high flow irrigation and hydro-dissection.

7. Discussion of Non-Clinical Tests Performed for Determination of
Substantial Equivalence are as follows: :
Advanced Medical disposable trocars and laparoscopic accessories met
the electrical, safety, EMC, and applicable testing requirements of IEC
60601-2-2:2006 4" Edition . .
/ None of the testing demonstrated any design characteristics that violated
the requirements of the standards or resulted in any safety hazards. ~ .
8. Discussion of Clinical Tests Performed:
Clinical testing.was not conducted.
9. Conclusions: ,
| Based on the information provided in this submission we conclude that
: the Advanced Medical Disposable Trocars and Laparoscopic
Accessories are substantially equivalent to the predicates and is safe
and effective for its intended use. . .

devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
a You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be-subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
