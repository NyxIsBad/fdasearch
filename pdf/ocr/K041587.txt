Common Name: Bipolar, Open Electrosurgical Instrument

Classification Name:

« Electrosurgical Cutting and Coagulation Device and Accessories, and
c * Gynecologic Electrocautery and Accessories
3. Predicate Devices

The LigaSure™ Open Dissector Divider (catalog number LS4100) is substantially

equivalent to the following legally marketed devices:

e For configuration, sealing and dissection capabilities the LS4100 is
substantially equivalent to the Valleylab LS1200 LigaSure™ Precise
Instrument (K010010)

« For cutting capabilities, the LS4100 is substantially equivalent to the Valleylab
LS1500 LigaSure™ 5mm Laparoscopic Sealer-Divider Instrument (K03101 1)

4. Device Description

The LigaSure Open Dissector Divider is a multi-functional, electrosurgical

instrument intended for use with the LigaSure Vessel Sealing Generator

(K981916) when performing open surgery. The instrument is capable of sealing

and dividing vessels and tissue clamped between its jaws, grasping tissue, and

dissection. Sealing of vessels and tissue containing vessels can be activated

using the activation button on the device or via a footswitch. The instrument also
incorporates a mechanical cutting mechanism that divides tissue.

The instrument attaches to the LigaSure™ generator with a ten (10} foot cable
and a “smart” connector that identifies the instrument type to the generator. The
instrument is supplied sterile for single-use.

8. Intended Use
The LigaSure™ Open Dissector Divider is a bipolar electrosurgical instrument
intended for use with the LigaSure Generator in open, general and gynecologic
surgical procedures where ligation and division of vessels is desired. This device
creates ligation by application of bipolar electrosurgical RF energy and pressure
{to vessels/tissue interposed between the jaws of the device. The ligation can
then be transected using the built in cutting mechanism. The device can be
used for vessels up to and including 7 mm in diameter and tissue bundies as
large as will fit into the jaws of the instrument.
Indications for use include general, open procedures including urologic, vascular,
thoracic, and plastic and reconstructive, procedures where dissection, ligation
and division of vessels are performed such as: spleenectomies, thryoidectomies,
nephrectomies, prostatectomies, bowel resection and colectomy.
The LigaSure Vessel Sealing System has not been shown to be effective for
tubal sterilization or tubal coagulation for sterilization procedures, and should not
be used for these procedures.

6. Summary of Technological Characteristics
The LigaSure™ Open Dissector Divider has the same basic technological
characteristics as the predicate devices noted above.

7. Performance Data ,
Performance (bench) testing and a preclinical study were done to ensure that the
LigaSure™ Open Dissector Divider functions as intended, and meets design
specifications. Sufficient data were obtained to show that the device is
substantially equivalent to the predicate devices, and meets safety and
effectiveness criteria.
