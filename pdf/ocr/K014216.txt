Intended Use
The Secca™ System is intended for general use in the electrosurgical coagulation
of tissue and intended for use specifically in the treatment of fecal incontinence in
those patients with incontinence to solid or liquid stool at least once per week and
who have failed more conservative therapy.
Substantial Equivalence
The Secca System is substantially equivalent to other marketed devices that have
received premarket clearance. The general intended use of the Secca System to
coagulate tissue electrosurgically is the same as the general intended use of Curon
Medical’s previously cleared Stretta System (K010210 and K000245) (“Stretta”),
Secca Tubular Electrode (K000170), A4000 Tubular Electrode (K992542), and
Stretta Inflatable Basket Electrode (K991291). The Secca System’s specific
indication for use for treatment of fecal incontinence is also substantially the same
as for a number of predicate biofeedback devices. Specifically, BioCare
International's BCI-100 Fecal Incontinence System (K904646) ("BCI-100
System") and Biosearch, Inc.'s Anorectal Biofeedback System 5 (K913736)
C"Anorectal System 5") are cleared for biofeedback training of the anal sphincter
in the treatment of fecal incontinence and/or constipation. Finally, FDA also has
cleared a number of other devices for use in anorectal procedures to perform
tissue ablation or coagulation, including Ethicon’s PowerStar Bipolar Scissors
(K981361) device, Ellman’s Surgitron Radiolase System and Accessories
(K992382), and Portlyn Corporation's Dynabite Hot Gastroenterology Biopsy
Forceps (K970083) device. Although these devices are not specifically indicated
for use in the treatment of fecal incontinence, like the Secca System they are all
generally used to apply electrical energy within the lower GI tract for treatment of
gastroenterological pathologies.
Comparing the principles of operation and the technological characteristics of the
Secca System to its predicates, the device and generator design also is
substantially similar to the Company's previously cleared Stretta System
(K010210 and K000245), except for a few minor modifications. Likewise, its
design is substantially similar to Curon’s cleared Tubular Electrodes (K000170
and K.992542) and Stretta Inflatable Basket Electrode (K991291). All of these
devices have been designed, tested, and produced by the same manufacturer in
. much the same manner.

Kél¥ 216 3/3
Any minor differences in indications between the Secca System and the
predicates do not alter its therapeutic effect, considering the impact on safety and
effectiveness, as confirmed by preclinical and clinical testing. Furthermore,
although minor modifications have been made to the technological features of the
Secca System since the Company's clearance of the predicate Stretta System,
these changes are minimal and do not affect the safety or effectiveness of the
Secca System. Thus, the Secca System presents no new significant technological
features compared to the previously cleared predicates. Therefore, because the
intended use and indications for use of the device are substantially the same as the
cleared predicates and there are no significant new technological features, the
device may be found substantially equivalent to those other devices,

Dear Mr. Kahan:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and we have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the
indications for use stated in the enclosure) to devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to
May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have
been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
(Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices,
good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

. If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 — Mr. Jonathan Kahan ~ a ,
