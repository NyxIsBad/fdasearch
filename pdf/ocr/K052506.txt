Device Information:

Classification: Class II

Trade Name: Rubicor EnCapsule™ Breast Biopsy Device

Classification Name: Electrosurgical Device and accessories (21 CFR 870.4400)

Equivalent Device:

The subject device and accessory are substantially equivalent in intended use and/or method

of operation to the Rubicor EnCapsule™ Breast Biopsy Device (K023601 & K030049)

Intended Use:

The EnCapsule Breast Biopsy Device is intended for diagnostic sampling of breast tissue

during breast biopsy procedures. It is to be used for diagnostic purposes only and is not

intended for therapeutic uses.

The EnCapsule Breast Biopsy Device is indicated to provide breast tissue samples for

diagnostic sampling of breast abnormalities. It is designed to provide breast tissue for

histologic examination with partial or complete removal of the imaged abnormality.

The extent of histologic abnormality cannot be reliably determined from its mammographic

appearance. Therefore, the extent of removal of the imaged evidence of an abnormality

does not predict the extent of removal of a histologic abnormality (e.g., malignancy). When

the sampled abnormality is not histologically benign, it is essential that the tissue margins be

examined for completeness of removal using standard surgical procedures.

Test Results:

Performance

Results of in-vitro testing demonstrate that the Rubicor EnCapsule Breast Biopsy Device is

safe and effective for its intended function.

Dear Dr. Chin:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class [I (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2- Robert J. Chin, Ph.D.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
“"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
