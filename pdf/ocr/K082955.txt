Device Description The Ethicon Endo Surgery® (EES) Articulating Hook Knife isa
monopolar instrument intended for use in endoscopic electrosurgical procedures where
cutting, dissecting, and cauterizing soft tissue are desired. The device consists of a flexible .
wire cable and hook knife electrode, which can be extended, rotated, and articulated from
the flexible outer shaft using two handle control knobs. In addition, the hook electrode can
be rotated independently of the end effector. When connected to an electrosurgical

: generator and activated, the hook knife delivers a monopolar electrical current to the
surgical site. This device passes through endoscopes having a 3.7 mm or larger working
channels. This device is supplied sterile for single-patient use.
. Indications for Use The Articulating Hook Knife is a monopolar electrosurgical
instrument intended for cutting, dissecting and cauterizing soft tissue during endoscopic
electrosurgical procedures. ; :
, : Technological Characteristics The EES device has similar technologic characteristics to
the predicate devices (K964175 and K912492) in that it contains a metal electrode tip that
is used to deliver monopolar energy to the surgical site. In all devices the electrode tip is in
: the shape of a ‘L’ Hook. All devices can be introduced through 5mm ports. ‘All devices are :
o designed to be connected to electrosurgical generators, and utilize RF monopolar energy /
oe for operation.

os ‘In addition, the Articulating Hook Knife device is very similar to the Articulating Needle
. Knife (K073046) in that it consists of an elongated flexible wire shaft and‘a handle. These

devices allow for the manipulation of the electrode via the handle of the device. Both

devices feature rotation and articulation of the end-effector to provide the clinician with

improved tissue-targeting capability.

, Performance Data. Bench testing was performed to demonstrate that the EES device
performs as intended. The patient contact portions of the device have been evaluated for
biocompatibility and comply with the requirements of ISO 10993-1. The device was tested
. to demonstrate compliance with the following standards: :

- Electrosurgical Devices, AAMI HF 18, 2001/01/01 : :

- Medical Electrical Equipment Part 2-2: Particular Requirements for the Safety of High

Frequency Surgical Equipment, IEC 60601-2-2, 2006/07/01 .

Dear Mr. Bosticco:
‘ We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
. referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act includé requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration. ‘
If your device is classified (see above) into either class IT (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
