510(k) Summary
Device Description
This device is used to activate the CUT and COAGULATE modes of an electrosurgical
generator in order to cut soft tissue via a handheld push button or rocker switch
controlled electrosurgical pencil. The body of the device has a molded plastic housing
with either two buttons (one for cut and one for coagulate) or a rocker switch located at
the distal end of the pencil. A ten foot cable exiting the housing features a universal three
prong plug allowing the pencil to be connected to the monopolar side of a standard
electrosurgical generator. A PTFE coated electrode or an uncoated stainless steel
electrode will be packaged with this device with the option of including an insulated
holster.
The Holster serves as an insulated container to store the pencil while it is inactive in order
to avoid accidental activation when not in use. The holster conveniently attaches to a
surgical drape.
The uncoated stainless steel electrode is used to cut and coagulate soft tissue, The PTFE
coated electrode is a stainless steel electrode coated with a non-stick material (PTFE),
which is also used to cut and coagulate soft tissue. The PTFE coating reduces the build
up of eschar on the electrode during use; thus, eliminates the need to clean or “scrape”
the electrode on an abrasive surface to remove the eschar buildup.
This device is a single use, disposable device which will be sold sterile and bulk nonsterile to be sterilized by the customer. Electrode tips are also single use, disposable
devices which may be sold individually sterile or bulk non-sterile to be sterilized by the
customer.
Intended Use
The intended use for this device is to conduct monopolar electrosurgical ,
energy from an electrosurgical unit (ESU), to an electrosurgical electrode
consequently to the intended tissue to be cut and/or coagulated.
Indications: General, urologic, thoracic, plastic/reconstructive, gynecologic,
laparoscopic and arthroscopic surgical procedures.
Technological Characteristics Comparison
The Xodus Medical disposable Electrosurgical Pencil is substantially equivalent in
material and operation to other electrosurgical pencils already on the market. All
materials used to manufacture the Electrosurgical Pencils and Electrodes are non-toxic
and are currently being utilized by our competitor’s in previously marketed devices.
There are no new technological characteristics associated with this device; thus, no new
questions of safety and effectiveness.

Dear Ms. Neil: ‘
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration, won nee Oe .
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may

or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
