Device Description
The Candela 3630 Laser System contains two separate Jaser heads (Alexandrite and Nd:YAG)
which produce laser light outputs of 755 nm and 1064 nm. The outputs of each laser head are
optically combined on the laser rail so that their beam paths are identical as they exit the laser
system. This allows the use of a single delivery system which can output either 755 nm, 1064 nm
wavelengths.
Each laser head contains the appropriate solid state laser rod and high intensity xenon flashlamps
to excite the laser medium. The laser heads are water cooled with a self contained circulating
water system that includes a water to air heat exchanger so the system can be fully air-cooled.
The temperature of the laser heads are regulated by the circulation of distilled water at a

controlled temperature. A high voltage power supp'y is used to charge a storage capacitor which
provides energy to the flashlamps. An IGBT (high voltage switch) is used to discharge the
capacitor through the flashlamp. Each laser head has its own dedicated IGBT switch which is
how the system controls which wavelength is produced. The resulting flash of the flashlamp
excites the laser rod which causes emission of a pulse of laser energy.
The Candela 3630 Laser System delivers laser energy with various pulse durations from 0,25
milliseconds to 300 milliseconds (See attached specification 9914-92-0400 for further details).
The output of this laser is delivered to the area of t:eatment by means of a lens coupled user
replaceable optical fiber with a treatment handpiece attached to its distal end. A trigger switch
(fingerswitch or footswitch) is used to control the delivery of laser pulses. The user may choose
to deliver a single pulse each time the trigger switch is depressed, or pulses may be delivered
repetitively as long as the switch is depressed, at repetition rates up to 10 pulses per second
(depending on the chosen pulse duration).

A microprocessor based system controller is used to monitor and direct all system functions,
Users of the laser select parameters such as desired energy density (fluence) level and repetition
rate and monitor operation via a touch screen and display pane]. The touch screen panel can also
be used to enable or disable the triggering of the laser, to initiate the calibration feature and to
obtain feedback from the system, such as the number of pulses delivered or spot size selected.
The Candela 3630 Laser System supports spot sizes from 1.5 to 18 mm.

Description of Intended Use

735nm

The Candela 3630 Laser System is indicated for the temporary hair reduction. Stable long-term
or permanent hair reduction through selective targeting of melanin in hair follicles, Permanent
hair reduction is defined as long-term stable reduction in the number of hairs regrowing after a
treatment regime. On all skin types (Fitzpatrick I-IV) including tamed skin.

Treatment of benign pigmented lesions. Treatmen: of wrinkles.

1064nm

The Candela 3630 Laser System is indicated for the removal of unwanted hair, for stable long

term or permanent hair reduction and for treatment of PFB. The lasers are indicted on all skin
types Fitzpatrick I-VI including tanned skin. Photocoagulation and hemostasis of pigmented and

vascular lesions such as but not limited to port wine stains, hemoangioma, warts, telangiectasia,

tosacea, venus lake, leg veins and spider veins. Coagulation and hemostasis of soft tissue. Benign

Pigmented lesions such as, but not limited to, lentigos (age spots), solar lentigos (sun spots), cafe

au lait macules, seborrheic keratoses, nevi, chloasma, verrucae, skin tags, keratoses, tattoos

(significant reduction in the intensity of black and/or blue-black tatoos) and plaques.

The laser is indicated for pigmented lesions to reduce lesion size, for patients with lesions that

would potentially benefit from aggressive treatment, and for patients with lesions that have not

responded to other laser treatments.

The laser is also indicated for the reduction of red pigmentation in hypertrophic and keloid scars

where vasoularity is an integral part of the scar,

Treatment of wrinkles.

Rationale for Substantial Equivalence

The Candela 3630 Laser System has the same intended use, utilizes similar functional features
(including power output, spot size, repetition rate, energy, and fluence) and matches key design
aspects (including wavelength, light generation medium, power supply, cooling and controls
system) , as the predicate devices.

The Candela 3630 Laser System shares similar methods of assembly, method of operation, and
intended uses, and therefore is substantially equivelent to the currently legally marketed Candela
GentleYAG Family of Laser Systems, K033172, Candela GentleLASE Family of Laser Systems,
K024371, K024335, K024260, and Cynosure Apoiee Elite Laser, 034030 predicate devices.
Safety and Effectiveness Information

The Candela 3630 Laser System is substantial ecuivalent to the currently legally marketed
Candela Gentle YAG Family of Laser Systems, K033172, Candela GentleLASE Family of Laser
Systems, K024371, K024335, K024260, and Cyncsure Apogee Elite Laser, K034030 predicate
devices in intended use and technological features and therefore the risks and benefits are
comparable to the predicate devices.

We therefore believe that there are no new questions of safety or effectiveness raised by the
introduction of the Candela 3630 Laser System.

Conclusion

Base on the similarities in indications for use, design features, and functional features the
Candela 3630 Laser System has been shown to be substantially equivalent to the current legally
marketed predicate devices.

Dear Mr. Roberts:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).

: You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
“Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
