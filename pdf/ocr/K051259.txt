Device Description:
The VersaClear™ Skin Therapy System is a 120/240V 50/60 Hz AC illumination source
consisting of one or more light modules. A set of light modules emits a specific narrow
spectrum of light, namely blue (420 + 2nm), red (615 + 3nm), or UVA (368 + 3nm). The
light modules are mounted on a positioning arm attached to a mobile or stationary
pedestal, a wall, or a countertop. This flexible design accommodates varying office
spatial settings, and allows for the treatment of patients who are sitting, reclining, or lying
down. Light modules are interchangeable to maximize System versatility.
Intended Use and Indications for Use:
The VersaClear System is intended to provide phototherapeutic light to the body. The
VersaClear is generally indicated to treat dermatological conditions. Blue light modules
are indicated to treat moderate inflammatory acne vulgaris. Red light modules are
indicated for use in combination with blue light for the treatment of moderate
inflammatory acne vulgaris, and for use alone in the treatment of superficial, benign
vascular, and pigmented lesions. UVA light modules are indicated for individuals who
require specific ultraviolet radiation therapy for diagnosed skin disorders.
Performance Data:
The performance characteristics of the VersaClear System are substantially similar to the
cited predicate devices. The technological differences do not raise new types of safety or
efficacy issues. On this basis, the VersaClear System is substantially equivalent to the
predicate devices.
Conclusion:
On the basis of the information provided in this Summary, TheraLight believes that the
VersaClear Skin Therapy System is substantially equivalent to legally commercialized
predicate devices.
