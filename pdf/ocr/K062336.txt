5.0 510(K) SUMMARY OF SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS
This 510(k) summary of safety and effectiveness information is being submitted in
accordance with the requirements of SMDA 1990 and 21 CFR 807.92.
APPLICANT OptiMedica Corporation
TRADE NAME: OptiMedica Laser Indirect Ophthalmoscope (LIO)
COMMON NAME: _Laser Indirect Ophthalmoscope (LIO)
DEVICE GEX
CLASSIFICATION 21 CFR 878.4810
Laser instrument, surgical, powered
. 5.1 SUBSTANTIALLY EQUIVALENT To:
The Laser Indirect Ophthalmoscope (LIO) is substantially equivalent in intended use and
the same or similar technological characteristics (including treatment and aiming
wavelengths, spot size, working distance and indirect ophthalmoscope used) as the Zeiss
LIO (K924588). The OptiMedica LIO is also substantially equivalent to the delivery
devices included in 510(k)s KO22181 (Novus VARIA and Delivery Devices ) and
K052526 (Novus 3000 and Delivery Devices ) by Lumenis and K991258 (Novus Verdi
Delivery Systems) by Coherent.
5.2. DESCRIPTION OF THE DEVICE SUBJECT TO PREMARKET NOTIFICATION
The OptiMedica Laser Indirect Ophthalmoscope (LIO) is intended for use in the
diagnosis and treatment of ocular pathology. The LIO illuminates and magnifies the
fundus image. When connected to the Pascal Retinal Photocoagulator, the laser aiming :
and treatment beams are precisely focused and delivered to the patient’s eye through the
LIO.

5.3. INDICATION FOR USE
The OptiMedica LIO is indicated for the delivery of laser energy in eyes with retinal
pathology. The OptiMedica LIO is indicated for use in the following ophthalmic
treatments and conditions:

¢ Diabetic retinopathy (panretinal photocoagulation)

e Macular degeneration

e Peripheral neovascularization

¢ Retinal breaks

¢ Retinal detachments

e Retinal tears

e Lattice degeneration

e Pneumatic retinopexy reattachment procedures

e Segmental peripheral photocoagulation

e Segmental photocoagulation

© Cloudy vitreous cavities

e Pediatric retinal repairs (under general anesthesia)

e Delivery of laser energy through small pupils or to eyes with focal lens opacities
5.4 CONTRAINDICATIONS
Laser surgery with the OptiMedica LIO is contraindicated when an appropriate procedure
cannot be performed safely. This occurs when tissue targets cannot be visualized
properly. Under such circumstances, an important tissue structure adjacent to a target
tissue might be photocoagulated inadvertently. Corneal opacities, cataract formation, and
vitreous hemorrhage can all interfere with the laser surgeon’s view of appropriate target
structures. Treatment should be delayed until the visualization has adequately improved.
5.5 TECHNICAL CHARACTERISTICS
Indirect Ophthalmoscope :
The OptiMedica LIO uses a Heine OMEGA 500 binocular indirect ophthalmoscope.
Each of the predicate devices, including the Zeiss Laser Indirect Ophthalmoscope
(K924588), the Lumenis Novus 3000 Delivery Devices (K052526), Lumenis Novus
VARIA Delivery Devices (K022181), and Coherent Novus Verdi Delivery Systems
(K991258) use a Heine binocular indirect ophthalmoscope as well.
Usable Wavelengths
The OptiMedica LIO is designed to be used with the Pascal Photocoagulator. This
system produces 532nm light for treatment, and 635 nm light for aiming, identical to the
Lumenis Novus 3000 (K052526), Lumenis Novus VARIA (K022181), Coherent Novus
Verdi (K991258), and the Zeiss Visulas system used with the Zeiss Laser Indirect
Ophthalmoscope (K924588).

Ee eee
Eye Filter Optical Density
The OptiMedica LIO eye safety filter optical density at the treatment wavelength is the
same as all of the predicate devices, OD>5. The OptiMedica LIO also uses a photopically
neutral filter to allow the high transmission of the aiming beam and white balance the
image, making visualization easier and more realistic.
Aerial Spot Size
The OptiMedica LIO spot size for delivery through indirect surgical lens is 960m. This
is almost identical to that of the Lumenis Novus 3000 (K052526), Lumenis Novus
VARIA (K022181), Coherent Novus Verdi (K991258), which are 973um. The Zeiss
Laser Indirect Ophthalmoscope (K924588) uses a 1060 1m spot.
Working Distance
The OptiMedica LIO working distance of 275mm lies right in the middle of the range
specified by the predicate devices. The Lumenis Novus 3000 (K052526), Lumenis
Novus VARIA (K022181), Coherent Novus Verdi (K991258) systems specify a 270mm
working distance. The Zeiss Laser Indirect Ophthalmoscope (K924588) uses a 280mm
working distance.
Fiber Length
The OptiMedica LIO fiber length of 5 meters is equal to that of the Zeiss Laser Indirect
Ophthalmoscope (K924588), and slightly longer than that of the Lumenis Novus 3000
(K052526), Lumenis Novus VARIA (K022181), Coherent Novus Verdi (K991258)
systems which use 4.6 meter long fibers.
Electrical Requirements
The OptiMedica LIO and all of the predicate devices use the same sort of illumination :
source, and therefore have the same electrical requirements.
Cooling Methods ,
The OptiMedica LIO and all of the predicate devices use the same sort of illumination
source, and therefore have the same cooling requirements and methods.
Weight
The OptiMedica LIO and all of the predicate devices use the same sort of binocular
indirect ophthalmoscope, and therefore have roughly the same weight.
Dimensions
The OptiMedica LIO and all of the predicate devices use the same sort of binocular
indirect ophthalmoscope, and therefore have roughly the same dimensions.

5.6 PERFORMANCE DATA
Performance testing has been conducted with the OptiMedica LIO to establish the optical
similarity of the OptiMedica LIO with respect to a predicate device, the Zeiss LIO, as a
means to assess the relative clinical performance of the devices. This was accomplished
by characterizing the optical performance of both laser delivery systems at their treatment
and aiming wavelengths. Optical transmissions, as well as the delivered spot size and
intensity profiles were measured.
5.7 BASIS FOR DETERMINATION OF SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE
The indications for use for the OptiMedica LIO are similar to the predicate LIOs cited in
this application. The safety of the materials used for the manufacture of LIO has
previously been demonstrated. Testing demonstrates that the OptiMedica LIO is
functionally equivalent to the predicate devices.

Dear Dr. Gordon:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for
use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce
prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good
manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply
with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part
807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the
quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product
radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 — Judy F. Gordon, D.V.M.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other
