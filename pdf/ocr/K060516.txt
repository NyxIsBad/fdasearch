Conclusion:

The Ellipse ’PL (B02) has been evaluated and compared to its predicate systems (to Ellipse
PPL (A01) (manufactured by DDD), and Ellipse Flex PPT (manufactured by DDD)). The
Ellipse PPL (B02) system, as far as the identical modules, applications and intended uses are
concerned, are identical to Ellipse ’PL (A01) and identical and substantially equivalent to the
Ellipse Flex PPT with regards to technology as well as modules, applications and intended
uses.

Based on this analysis of the overall performance characteristics of the mentioned predicate
devices Danish Dermatologic Development A/S (DDD) concludes that no significant
differences exist. The applications added to the original Ellipse PPL system does not raise
new issues of safety and effectiveness and is substantially equivalent to the mentioned
predicate devices.
