Device Description:
The Canady Plasma Probes are tubular instruments and are flexible. They are provided in
various lengths and diameter sizes to accommodate the various size/types of endoscopes for
a variety of applications (i.e. the treatment of various target tissues inside a patient). The
Probes have applications in endoscopic surgical procedures such as upper and lower
gastroenterology and bronchoscopy to provide a means of coagulation using electrosurgical
current and argon gas.
The device consists of a connector which acts also as a handle for maneuvering the probe
inside the working channel of an endoscope. Via an inner lumen of the Canady Plasma
Probe argon gas is delivered to the operative site as well as an internal wire to carry high
frequency (HF) electrosurgical current to a tungsten electrode tip at the end of the tubing. A
ceramic tip insulates the thermal plastic tubing from the heat generated during coagulation.
1 The electrode is positioned in the ceramic tip such that it cannot contact the patient's tissue
| during coagulation procedure.

" 510(k) Summary TECHNOLOGY
The Canady Plasma Probes are provided sterile by means of ethylene oxide and are
isposable (Single Use
dispo (Sing ) (nae 2 4D
Application
An endoscope is manipulated inside the patient to locate tissue that requires treatment. Upon
finding the target tissue, the Canady Plasma Probe is threaded into the working channel of
the endoscope, until the tip of the Probe slightly protrudes from the end of the scope. Then
opening of the Probe is positioned towards in close proximity of the area to be treated. The
Canady Plasma Probes have depth marker rings close to the tip for positioning purposes.
When high frequency voltages reaches the certain level and the proximity to tissue is close
enough, electrically conductive argon plasma forms in the gas stream. This allows the
current to flow between the probe and the tissue. Current density upon arrival at the tissue
surface from an APB probe (Argon Plasma Beam) causes coagulation. The application of the
energy to the tissue is uniform and contact free. Canady Plasma Probes are for single use
only.
: Intended Use:
The Canady Plasma Probes' intended use is for the delivery of argon gas plasma energy for
argon enhanced coagulation of tissue.
Electrical Characteristic:
Canady Plasma Probes can be operated in combination with HF generators which are ©
compatible to the connector hose cleared under K#013348 to a
max. HF voltage of 4.0 kVp / max. HF power of 50W __ for the TBS probes
max. HF voltage of 4.3 kVp / max. HF power of 909W_ _for the GIT probes (2.3 mm)
max. HF voltage of 4.3 kVp / max. HF power of 120 W for the GIT probes (3.2 mm)
Dimensions:
The lengths of the Canady Argon Probes are 1.6 m (5.2 ft) to 3.4 m (11 ft). The diameters of
the probes are 1.5 mm (4.5 Fr) to 3.2 mm (9.6 Fr).
Similarities to Predicate Devices:
The Canady Plasma Probes have the same performance specifications and intended use
like the predicate devices. They are also provided sterile by ethylene oxide and are
disposables for single use only. The connector is compatible in function to the connector of
the probe which is cleared in K#013348 and also compatible to the corresponding connector
hose.
The tube diameters and lengths are very similar. Both, the Canady Plasma Probes and the
predicate devices have marking rings at the distal end (scaled probe tip). Also the used
materials — which is ceramic at the distal end and Teflon for the tubes of the probes - are
identical. in consequence the insulation characteristic is the same. The electrical
characteristics are one and the same.
Differences to Predicate Devices:
The connectors of the predicate devices K#990586 and K#963189 are different.
Conclusions:
Canady Plasma Probes are substantial equivalent in its intended Use, Dimensions, Used
Materials, Construction, Quality, Electrical Characteristics, Operational Principles and
Labeling to the legally marketed devices to which the Canady Plasma Probes are compared
| in this submission.
| The differences do not affect safety and effectiveness.

Dear Mr. Preiss:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2- Mr. Stefan Preiss
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
“Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
