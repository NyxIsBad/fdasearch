Intended Use / Indications for Use
The Ceralas D 980 is intended for delivery of laser light to soft tissue in the contact
or non-contact mode during surgical procedures, including via endoscopes,
introducers, or catheters. The Ceralas D 980 is generally indicated for incision,
excision, vaporization, ablation, hemostasis, or coagulation of soft tissue in ear, nose
and throat and oral surgery (otolaryngology), dental procedures, arthroscopy,
gastroenterology, general surgery, dermatology, plastic surgery, podiatry, urology,
gynecology, neurosurgery (peripheral nervous system), pulmonary surgery, and
cardiothoracic surgery. This Ceralas D 980 is specifically indicated for hemostasis
and coagulation of soft tissue (including cardiac tissue) and laser assisted lipolysis.
Specific Indications for Use

Technological Characteristics
The Ceralas D 980 for laser assisted lipolysis has the same technological
characteristics as the cleared Ceralas and substantially similar technological
characteristics as compared to the Cynosure SmartLipo laser.
Performance Data
No performance data is being submitted.
Substantial Equivalence
The Ceralas D is as safe and effective as Biolitec’s cleared Ceralas Diode Laser
System (K964497, K993911, K032863, K983058, K991891, K993002), as well as the
Cynosure SmartLipo Laser Nd:YAG Laser System (K062321). The Ceralas D has
the same intended uses and similar indications, technological characteristics, and
principles of operation as its predicate devices. The minor technological differences
between the Ceralas D and its predicate devices raise no new issues of safety or
effectiveness. Thus, the Ceralas D is substantially equivalent.

Dear Mr. Kahan:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally markeled predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market,
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance
