The fundamental technical characteristics and device specifications of the Nidek
Green Laser Photocoagulator Model GYC-1000 are the same as those of the predicate
device. The Model GYC-1000 and the predicate device are frequency doubled solidstate lasers with a wavelength of 532 nm. The Model GYC-1000 and the predicate
device use a variety of delivery systems, including slit lamps, indirect
ophthalmoscopes, endoprobes, and Nd:YAG lasers to deliver the laser beam. The
Model GYC-1000 and the predicate device are indicated for use in macular and
retinal photocoagulation, and glaucoma procedures such as iridotomy and
trabeculoplasty.
4. DEVICE DESCRIPTION
The Nidek Green Laser Photocoagulator Model GYC-1000 is a frequency doubled
diode pumped solid state (DPSS) laser ophthalmic photocoagulation system that
produces a 532 nm (green) wavelength light as the treatment beam. The Model
GYC-1000 uses a diode laser (red) with a wavelength of 635 nm as the aiming beam.
The green laser beam is aligned with the red aiming laser beam in the optical system
inside the unit and gathers them in a fiber-optic cable. The laser beam is led to the
delivery unit via the fiber-optic cable, shaped into the specified spot size in the optical
system, and emitted to the affected area (the emission areas of both the therapeutic
laser beam and the aiming beam are the same).
The Model GYC-1000 can be used to coagulate the target tissue efficiently and
safely, and the system can be applied to transpupillary photocoagulation procedures
using a slit-lamp or indirect ophthalmoscope and intraocular photocoagulation
procedures using an endophotocoagulation probe. The Model GYC-1000 is a
smaller, modified version of the Models GYC-1500 and GYC-2000, which were the
subject of premarket notification number K980547.
A protective filter may be attached to each delivery unit in the observation optical
path so that the operator’s eye can be protected from the laser beam if it is reflected

from a patient’s eye or contact lens during laser emission. The Model GYC-1000 has
a number of delivery units available for use in a variety of ophthalmic procedures:
e Endophotocoagulation Delivery Unit
e NIDEK Slit-Lamp Delivery Unit
e ZEISS Slit-Lamp Attachable Delivery Unit
e HAAG Attachable Slit-Lamp Delivery Unit
e Binocular Indirect Ophthalmoscope Delivery Unit .
e Combination Delivery Unit for Nidek Nd:YAG laser
5. INDICATIONS FOR USE
The Nidek Green Laser Photocoagulator Model GYC-1000 is indicated for use in
ophthalmic surgical procedures, including retinal and macular photocoagulation,
iridotomy and trabeculoplasty.
6. TECHNOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS
A comparison of the technological characteristics of the Nidek Green Laser
Photocoagulator Model GYC-1000 and the predicate device has been performed, and
the results are summarized in the table below. The results of this comparison
demonstrate that the Nidek Green Laser Photocoagulator Model GYC-1000 has the
same basic technological characteristics as the predicate device and is equivalent to
the marketed predicate device. The differences between the Nidek Green Laser
Photocoagulator Model GYC-1000 and the predicate device are insignificant and do
not affect the safety or effectiveness of the device.
