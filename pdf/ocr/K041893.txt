4, A DESCRIPTION OF THE DEVICE THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF THE 510(k),
INCLUDING EXPLANATION OF HOW THE DEVICE FUNCTIONS, BASIC SCIENTIFIC
CONCEPTS, SIGNIFICANT PHYSICAL AND PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS
(DESIGN, MATERIAL, PHYSICAL PROPERTIES):

The INTRALASE FS Laser is a precision ophthalmic surgical laser designed for

use in performing lamellar and full thickness or penetrating corneal resections.

The cutting action of the IVTRALASE FS Laser is achieved through precise

individual micro-photodisruptions of tissue, created by tightly focused ultrashort

pulses which are delivered through a disposable applanation lens while fixating
the eye under very low vacuum.

5. STATEMENT OF INTENDED USE:

The INTRALASE® FS Laser is an ophthalmic surgical laser with the following

indications for use:

e In patients undergoing surgery or other treatment requiring initial lamellar
resection of the cornea.

e In patients undergoing surgery or other treatment requiring initial lamellar
resection of the cornea to create tunnels for placement of corneal ring
segments

e In lamellar keratoplasty and corneal harvesting

e In the creation of a corneal flap in patients undergoing LASIK surgery or
other treatment requiring initial lamellar resection of the cornea.

e In the creation of a lamellar cut/resection of the cornea for lamellar
keratoplasty and in the creation of a penetrating cut/incision for penetrating
keratoplasty.

These additional indications for use are identical to those of the predicate devices.

6. STATEMENT OF HOW THE TECHNOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DEVICE
COMPARE TO THOSE OF THE PREDICATE OR LEGALLY MARKETED DEVICE.

The technological characteristics of the INTRALASE FS Laser have already been

cleared under K002890 for corneal harvesting. The design, materials, and

characteristics of the laser keratome are the same irrespective of the indication for
use.

7. BRIEF SUMMARY OF NONCLINICAL TESTS AND RESULTS:
The INTRALASE FS Laser has undergone testing in accordance with applicable
safety standards. In addition, the INTRALASE FS was found to perform
equivalently to the predicate devices with respect to the creation of partial or full
thickness corneal resections in the creation of a lamellar cut/resection of the
cornea for lamellar keratoplasty and in the creation of a penetrating cut/incision
for penetrating keratoplasty. Thus, the INTRALASE FS Laser and the predicate
device have similar safety, effectiveness and performance profiles.

Dear Dr. Gordon:
This letter corrects our substantially equivalent letter of July 29, 2005.
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices,
good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be
found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); medical device reporting (reporting of medical

device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
go to http://www. fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/CDRH/CDRHOffices/ucm 1 15809.htm for
the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance. Also, please
note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part
807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21
CFR Part 803), please go to
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH’s Office
of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance.
You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the
Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number
