The Gyrus ENT G II Radio-frequency Workstation has two modes of operation:

- The monopolar mode has controls for maximum temperature and energy delivered. The unit
has readouts for total energy delivered, impedance, temperature for two thermocouples and time
of energy delivery.

- The bipolar mode has controls for output waveform type and power. The unit has readouts for
set power and waveform. .

Connectors on the front panel include the monopolar connector for active electrode and dispersive

electrode and separate dual bipolar connectors for PlasmaCision electrodes and bipolar instruments.

The foot pedal is connected on the back panel. Accessories included with the G II Radio
frequency Workstation include the PlasmaCision electrodes, bipolar instruments, connector cable,

footswitch and a power cable.

Comparison to Predicate Devices: :

The Gyrus ENT G II Radio-frequency Workstation has been carefully compared to legally

marketed devices with respect to intended use and technological characteristics. In addition,

performance testing has been done to validate the performance of the device. The comparison and
validation results presented show that the device is substantially equivalent to predicate devices and
is safe and effective in its intended use.

Dear Mr. Cobb:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

510(k) Number (if known): K021777
Device Name: G II Radio-frequency Workstation & Accessories
Indications For Use:
The PlasmaKinetic Generator section of the GIJ RF Workstation is indicated for ablation, resection and coagulation
of soft tissue and hemostasis of blood vessels in otorhinolaryngology (Head and Neck) surgery including:
e Adenoidectomy Neck Mass
¢ Cysts e Papilloma Keloids
e Head, Neck, Oral, and Sinus Surgery © Submucosal Palatal Shrinkage
e Mastoidectomy © Tonsillectomy
. e Myringotomy with effective Hemorrhage Control ¢ Traditional Uvulopalatoplasty (RAUP)
e Nasal Airway Obstruction by Reduction of © Tumors
Hypertrophic Nasal Turbinates © Tissue in the Uvula/Soft Palate for the Treatment of
© Nasopharyngeal / Laryngeal indications including Snoring
Tracheal Procedures, Laryngeal Polypectomy, and
Laryngeal Lesion Debulking
The Gyrus ENT Somnoplasty TCRF Generator section of the GIT RF Workstation with the Temperature
Controlled Radio-frequency (Somnoplasty®) Electrodes is indicated for coagulation of soft tissue including:
The coagulation of enlarged tonsils in patients 13 years of age and older; the reduction of the incidence of airway
obstructions, e.g., base of tongue, soft palate, etc., in patients suffering from UARS or OSAS; tissue coagulation in
the inferior turbinates; and tissue coagulation in the uvula/soft palate which may reduce the severity of snoring in
some individuals.
The system is intended for use by qualified medical personnel trained in the use of electrosurgical equipment and
familiar with potential complications that may arise during or following Head and Neck surgery.
Contraindications for Use:
There are no known absolute contraindications to the use of radio-frequency surgery. The use of the Gyrus ENT G II
