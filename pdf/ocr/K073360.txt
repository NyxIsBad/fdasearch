Classification: Class I
Product Code: GEI
Regulation Number: 21 CFR 878.440
1. Indications for use
The PROPLATE of Bio Protech is a disposable, single use, neutral electrode, which provides a
return path for high frequency electrical current to the ESU device.
2. Description of Product
The PROPLATE Electrosurgical Grounding Plate (and as also to be offered for sale under
various private label trade names) is a flexible, conductive adhesive electrosurgical grounding
plate with integrated 3 meter PVC coated cable and standard MSB-female connector. It is an
Electrosurgical Grounding Plate at which no electrosurgical effect is intended. It is also known as
the patient plate or inactive, indifferent, neutral, retum or dispersive electrode. It is frequently,
and sometimes inaccurately, referred to as the ground plate. The Electrosurgical Grounding Plate
is for use with monopolar instruments only.
The role of the Electrosurgical Grounding Plate is preventing highly current density from doing
damage to the patient’s tissue. And Electrosurgical Grounding Plate transfer input current from
the active electrode to ESU device in operation. The Electrosurgical Grounding Plate is large in
area, compared to the active electrode, promoting low current density and thereby reducing the
possibility or risk of electrosurgical effect or burns. The PROPLATE is made from conductive
hydro gel and aluminum foil. The adhesive on the backing material prevent them from falling off
the patient’s skin during operation. The plates are supplied either uncorded or corded. The

electrodes are packaged with 100 pieces (Uncorded plates) or 25 pieces (Corded plates) per an
inner box. The plates are provided non-sterile with an expiration date of 24 months.

The PROPLATE ahs the same intended use, uses the same material and has the same
performance characteristics as the predicate device. Both devices have met the HF-18
requirements for electrical safety both meet ISO 10993 Standards for biocompatibility.
Based on the similarities of the two devices Bio Protech concludes that no new issues of
safety and effectiveness have been raised and thus it is substantially equivalent to the
predicate device.

Dear Mr. Rongero:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of :
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class I] (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance
