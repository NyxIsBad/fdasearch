3. Substantial Equivalence |
(a) DORO® Non-Stick Bipolar Forceps: i
The DORO® Non-Stick Bipolar Forceps are substantially equivalent to other legally marketed Bipolar Forceps
from different manufacturers, Ginter Bissinger Medizintechnik GmbH (product: CLARIS NON-STICK bipolar forceps, ;
K51429), e.g. Link Technology, Inc. (product: Silverglide Surgical Technologies, K992931). :
The DORO® Non-Stick Bipolar Forceps are for use in general surgical procedures. These devices are connected
through a suitable bipolar cable with the bipolar output of an electrosurgical generator. The forceps are designed to '
grasp and manipulate selected tissues. Coagulation is achieved using electrosurgical energy generated by the !
electrosurgical generator unit and activated by a footswitch.
During the coagulation of tissue, the coagulated tissue may stick to the tip of the forceps. This undesirable effect
can be eliminated by the non-stick properties of the unique solid silver alloy tip forceps of the DORO line. The solid
silver alloy tip provides excellent thermal properties and eliminates the difficult and time-consuming cleaning of the i
forceps during a procedure. The non-stick properties are permanent since it is not a coating and the non-stick
properties are retained through repeated and frequent sterilizations.
Reusable Standard two-pin round connector cables are designed to work well with all foot-switching bipolar elec- :
trosurgical generators. :

7. Sterilization by User
DORO® Non-Stick Bipolar Forceps and DORO® Bipolar Reusable Cables are delivered in non-sterile conditions.
The user may sterilize these devices by using a validated and applicable sterilization process.
Cleaning and Maintenance
Every surgical instrument should be disinfected and thoroughly cleaned after each use. Proper cleaning, inspection
and maintenance will help ensure correct function of the surgical instrument. Clean, inspect and test each instrument carefully. Sterilize all instruments before surgery. A good cleaning and maintenance procedure will extend the
useful life of the instrument.
Special attention must be paid to slots, stops, ends, hollow tubes and other highly inaccessible areas. Check insulation, cables and connectors for cuts, voids, cracks, tears, abrasions, etc.
Do not use damaged instruments.
Cleaning and rinsing must take place immediately after each use for best effect. Failure to clean promptly may :
result in adherent particles or dried secretions that may resist cleaning and complicate or resist future sterilization.
Instruments must be completely cleaned and rinsed of all foreign matter.
Use warm water and a commercially available instrument pre-soak or cleaning agent. Enzymatic cleaners (such as :
Enzol™) must be used to remove protein deposits. Follow the enzymatic cleaner’s instructions; rinse thoroughly.
Do not use corrosive cleaning agents (i.e. bleach). Cleaning solutions and rinses at or near a neutral pH (7.0) are :
best. i
Do not use abrasive cleaners.
Only a soft bristle brush should be used.
Immerse the entire device in detergent and clean while soaking.
Rinse with sterile deionized water.
Can be disinfected in the washing machine up to 203°F (95°C).
Rinse thoroughly with distilled water. i
Prepare for storage and/or sterilization. |
