Common Name: Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation device and accessories oO
Classification: Class Il per 21 CFR 878.4400
Product Code: GEI
Predicate Devices: Habib 4X (K051420)
Cool-Tip RF System (K984552)
Intended Use:
The Habib 4X Laparoscopic is intended to be used to assist in coagulation of tissue during
intraoperative and laparoscopic surgical procedures
Description:
The Habib 4X Laparoscopic is a bipolar radiofrequency (RF) device that consists of a handle, an
instrument shaft, and an array of four needles at the distal end of the instrument. The instrument
has an attached cable which connects the device directly to the RITA Medical 1500X RF
generator. The device electrodes are inserted into tissue and the tissue is coagulated using the
RF power. The Habib 4X Laparoscopic is designed for use in laparoscopic surgery and the
instrument shaft fits through a standard 10mm laparoscopic port. The handle includes an RF
on/off switch which can be operated with either the left or right hand. The Habib 4X Laparoscopic
is a single use device.
Technological Differences: The RITA Medical Systems, Inc. Habib 4X Laparoscopic has the same technological
characteristics as the Habib 4X (K051420). The configuration of the electrodes and the method

the device uses to coagulate tissues is identical. The differences are primarily to facilitate the use
of the device through a laparoscopic port. The Habib 4X Laparoscopic has similar technological
characteristics as the Cool-Tip RF System (K984552) in that they both use electrodes and RF
energy to coagulate tissue and have the same intended use.
Performance Data:
Performance testing was done to ensure that the Habib 4 X Laparoscopic functions as intended and
meets design specifications. Sufficient data was obtained to show that the device is substantially
equivalent to the predicate device, and meets safety and effectiveness criteria.

Dear Mr. Christensen:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for
use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce
prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good
manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply
with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part
807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the
quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product
radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market. /
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
