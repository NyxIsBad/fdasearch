Description of Device
The Switch-Blade® scissor tip product family consists of three configurations differing only in
size and shape. The Switch-Blade® is supplied sterile in an individual Tyvek® pouch; six of
these pouches are placed in 6 unit box (i.e. sales unit). The product is intended to be single
use and is used in conjunction with catalog numbers 90-1050, 90-1150 or 90-1250 to achieve
electrosurgical cutting and coagulation of tissue. The device consists of metal and polymer
components.
Indications for Use
Intended Use
The Switch-Blades® product is included in the indications for use of “Endoscopic
Electrodes and Electrocautery instruments” which are intended to be “connected to
electrosurgical units via cable to allow monopolar cutting and coagulation”. The intended
use is contained in the Snowden Pencer Endoscopic Electrodes and Electrocautery
Instruments IFU (instructions for use) document # 26-0188. The device IFU is further
supplemented with a pictorial IFU contained in the disposable sale unit packaging
document # 26 0043. Copies of these documents are provided in attachment II of this
document
Technology Characteristics
The Switch-Blade® product functions on the well established methods/characteristics of
monopolar high frequency electro-surgery as do all of its listed predicates. The
performance/technological characteristics of the Switch-Blade® product and its predicates are
dictated by national and international standard (i.e. 60601-2-2, 60601-2-18 and AAMI HF
18(same as 60601-2-18)) and are therefore the same.

assurance (11135) have been and/or will be perfcrmed prior to product release. (NOTE
previous statements regarding have been and/or will be prior to product release refer to
sterility assurance activities related to the performance of validations in accordance with ISO
11135 i.e. load 3 testing)

Dear Ms. Danielson:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device

You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of

be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may

CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
