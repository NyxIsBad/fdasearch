E. Device Description
The Straight Fire Holmium Laser Fiber is a fiber optic laser energy delivery
device consisting of a silica core fiber jacketed with ethelylene tetraflouroethylene
(ETFE) and a SMA 905 connector. It is equipped with a polished, flat output tip.
This fiber may be used in a variety of laser based surgical cases as an integral part
of laser systems.
For use with Ho:YAG laser systems with a standard SMA 905 connector that
have been cleared for surgical use. Recommended Ho:YAG lasers are Dornier
and New Star.

F. Intended Use
The Straight Fire Holmium Laser Fiber is intended for use in laser-based surgical
applications, including, but not limited to endoscopic, laparascopic and open
surgical procedures involving vaporization, ablation and fragmentation of calculi
(urinary and biliary) and surgical procedures involving vaporization, ablation,
coagulation, hemostasis, excision, resection and incision of soft and cartilaginous
tissue.
The Straight Fire Holmium Laser Fiber is designed for use with holmium
(Ho:YAG) lasers with a standard SMA 905 connector that have been cleared for
surgical use.

G. Technological Characteristics
The Straight Fire Holmium Laser Fiber has the same technological characteristics
(i.e. SMA 905 connector, length of fiber optic cable, and strain relief) as the
predicate devices.

H. Substantial Equivalence
Utilizing FDA’s Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff “Format for Traditional
and Abbreviated 510(k)s” a direct comparison of key characteristics
demonstrates that the proposed laser fiber is substantially equivalent to the
predicate device in terms of intended use, technological characteristics, and
performance characteristics. The Straight Fire Holmium Laser Fiber is as safe, as
effective, and performs as well as the predicate devices.

Dear Kachi Enyinna:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class If (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

Page 2 — Kachi C. Enyinna
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance
at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address
