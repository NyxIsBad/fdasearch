V. Indications for Use
The GenticY AG Laser is intended for the treatment of Pseudofolliculitis Barbae.
VI. Rationale for Substantial Equivalence
The Candela GentleY AG Laser shares the same indications for use, matches key design
aspects, including spot size, similar wavelength and/or the same maximum delivered
power as the predicate devices, and therefore is substantially equivalent to the predicate
devices.
VII. Safety and Effectiveness Information
The new indications for use are based on the indications for use for the predicate laser
systems.
A clinical study produced results that indicate the GentleY AG is safe and effective for
the treatment of Psuedofolliculitis Barbae.
Technologically, the Candela GentleY AG Laser is identical to the previous predicate
Candela Long Pulse Nd: YAG Laser (K010104), the Laserscope Lyra Surgical Laser
System (K003147) and the Altus CoolGlide Laser (K014040), therefore the risks and
benefits for the GentleYAG Laser are comparable to these predicate device (s). :
We therefore believe that there are no new questions of safety or effectiveness raised by
the introduction of the device.
VIII. Conclusion
It is the opinion of Candela Corporation that the GentleY AG Laser System is
substantially equivalent to the predicate devices based on operating principles, materials,
mechanism of action, design, construction, methods of assembly and for the treatment of
Psuedofolliculitis Barbae.
