Equivalent Device: SIROLaser by Sirona Dental Systems, K053161
DioDent II Dental Laser System by HOYA ConBio, K050274
Twilight Diode Laser System by BioLase Technologies, K991994
Device Description: The laser source of the DioDent Micro 810/980 is a solid-state
Gallium Aluminum Arsenide (GaAIAs) semiconductor diode. It
produces invisible laser energy at the 810-nanometer or 980nm
wavelength. The delivery system consists of an autoclavable
: flexible treatment fiber threaded through a lightweight,
autoclavable hand piece. Activation occurs when the operator
enables the laser and presses the footswitch. Releasing the
footswitch suspends laser treatment. The footswitch can function
. as an owoff switch. A color touch-screen display panel allows
the operator to adjust or set laser output level with minimal effort.
