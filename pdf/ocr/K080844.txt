Disposables, ‘
Monopolar electrodes (TCRF)
- Bipolar PlasmaCision Electrodes
Connector Cables ,
Monopolar return pad; and
Footswitch.
The Gyrus G3 System Generator has two principal modes of operation dependant on which
type of electrode is attached - The monopolar mode has controls for maximum temperature
and energy delivered. The unit has readouts for total energy delivered, impedance, temperature
for two thermocouples and time of energy delivery. - The bipolar mode has controls for output
waveform type and power. The unit has readouts for set power and waveform. Connectors on
the front panel include the monopolar connector for active electrode and dispersive electrode
and separate dual bipolar connectors for PlasmaCision electrodes and bipolar instruments. The
device is operated by a foot pedal, connected on the back panel.
The Dissector Plasma Knife is a single use disposable bipolar instrument designed for use
with the G3 generator within an ambient air environment. The instrument incorporates a
suction channel, which allows for suction of fluids and gases during operative procedures
when connected to an appropriate suction facility.
