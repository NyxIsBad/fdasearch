Classification Name
Accessory to Surgical Laser Instrument
Predicate Device
Biolitec Inc MegaBeam Sterile Fiber optic Delivery System’s Bare Fibers
Coherent VersaSpot & Collimated Handpiece
Coherent Ultrafine TrueSpot Collimating Handpiece
Intended Use
The company’s MegaBeam/Ceralas Non Sterile Collimating Handpiece is intended to be used as a
fiber optic delivery accessory to a laser device. Please refer to the Laser User Manual for
complete list of indications.
Technological Characteristics and Substantial Equivalence
/ The Mega Beam/Ceralas Collimating Handpiece consists of a 3 meter quartz optical fiber encased
in an anodized aluminum handpiece. The aluminum handpiece has lenses that collimate the beam
to create a 7mm beam and resulting 7mm spot size. The MegaBeam/Ceralas Collimating
Handpiece maximum power output was less than the predicate devices and its divergence angle is
less than the predicate. However, these technological differences do not raise any new questions
of safety and effectiveness, as demonstrated by the performance data.
Performance Data
Biolitec conducted testing comparing the MegaBeam/Ceralas Collimating Handpiece’s and the
MegaBeam Bare Fiber’s handpiece efficiency, energy density and divergent half angle. These
1

performance tests demonstrate that the MegaBeam /Ceralas Collimating Handpiece is as safe and
effective as the Fiber Optic Delivery System’s Bare Fiber.
Substantial Equivalencies
The MegaBeam/Ceralas Collimating Handpiece has the same intended use as all three of its
predicate devices, the same indications as one of the predicate devices, except that it cannot be
used in endoscopic applications, and very similar principles of operation as the predicate
collimating handpieces and similar technica} characteristics as a combination of the predicate
devices, The minor technical differences between the MegaBeamy/Ceralas Collimating Handpiece
and its predicate devices do not raise new questions of safety or effectiveness. Performance data
Demonstrates that the MegaBeam/Ceralas Collimating Handpiece is as safe and effective as its
predicate device. Thus, the MegaBeatn/Ceralas Collitnating Handpiece is substantially equivalent.

Dear Dr. Morello:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801 and
additionally 21 CFR Part 809.10 for in vitro diagnostic devices), please contact the Office of
