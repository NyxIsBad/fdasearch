STATEMENT OF INTENDED USE:
The IntraLase Fusion™ Laser is an ophthalmic surgical laser indicated for use in the creation of a
corneal flap in patients undergoing LASIK surgery or other treatment requiring initial lamellar
resection of the cornea.
STATEMENT OF HOW THE TECHNOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DEVICE COMPARE TO THOSE
OF THE PREDICATE OR LEGALLY MARKETED DEVICE:
The technological characteristics of the IntraLase Fusion Laser have are substantially equivalent to
those cleared under K060372 for lamellar corneal resections and incisions.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF NONCLINICAL TESTS AND RESULTS:
The IntraLase Fusion Laser has undergone testing and is in compliance with applicable safety
standards. The IntraLase Fusion Laser and the accessory IntraLase Fusion Patient Interface were
found to perform equivalently to the predicate laser and patient interface for the creation of corneal
resections. Thus, the IntraLase Fusion Laser and the predicate device have similar safety,
effectiveness and performance profiles.

Dear Dr. Gordon:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
genera! controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (sée above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class IIT (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean

or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
