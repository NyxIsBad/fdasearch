. Proprietary Name: ACMI BICAP COAG Bipolar Laparoscopy Probe

Common Name: Laparoscopy Probe
Classification Name: Endoscopic electrosurgical unit and accessories,

21 CFR 876.4300
Substantially Equivalent Devices:
The BICAP COAG Bipolar Laparoscopy Probe to the ACMI Bipolar Hemostatic
Electrode (K803214) and the Cabot Medical Surgiflex Suction-Irrigation Probe
(K932626). : .
Description of Device:
The 5 mm ACMI BICAP COAG Bipolar Laparoscopy Probe (32 cm working length) is
designed for laparoscopic coagulation, irrigation, and aspiration. The RF current path
within the patient is identical to standard bipolar; consequently, the need for a patient
dispersive electrode is eliminated. The current flow through the tissue is localized to help
prevent a thermal effect distant from the surgical site.
The BICAP COAG Bipolar Laparoscopy Probe connects to ACMI Surgiflex WAVE
suction-irrigation tubing sets. Use of the BICAP COAG Probe can help reduce operating
room time by reducing the number of instrument exchanges. With a bipolar tip at the end
of the suction-irrigation shaft, hemostasis, blunt dissection, irrigation, and aspiration may

be readily performed without withdrawing the instrument. The oval tip design of the
probe provides easy, less traumatic access to ovarian and tubal cysts and other difficult to
reach areas. BICAP COAG instruments are compatible with most bipolar generators,
allowing them to be used with existing equipment.
Intended Use:
The BICAP COAG Bipolar Laparoscopy Probe is indicated for use in laparoscopic
procedures to provide bipolar coagulation, blunt dissection, irrigation, and aspiration.
The BICAP COAG Probe may be used in a variety of gastrointestinal, urological and
gynecological procedures.
Summary Comparison of Technological Characteristics Compared to Predicate
Devices:
The ACMI Bipolar Hemostatic Electrode is virtually identical to the BICAP COAG
Bipolar Laparoscopy Probe in design and functions (coagulation, blunt dissection,
suction, irrigation) except that the Bipolar Hemostatic Electrode was intended for use
only in gastrointestinal procedures, while the BICAP COAG Probes are intended for
general laparoscopic use including gastrointestinal, urological and gynecological
procedures.
The Cabot Medical Surgiflex Suction-Irrigation Probe is similar to the BICAP COAG
Probe in regard to functions (coagulation, blunt dissection, suction, irrigation) and both
are intended for general laparoscopic use including gastrointestinal, urological and
gynecological procedures. The primary difference is that the Surgiflex Probe is
monopolar while the BICAP COAG operates as a bipolar device.

Dear Mr. Fucile:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and we have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the
: indications for use stated in the enclosure) to devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to
May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have
been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
(Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices,
good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
. may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation contro! provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801 and
additionally 21 CFR Part 809.10 for in vitro diagnostic devices), please contact the Office of
Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Additionally, for questions on the promotion and advertising of
