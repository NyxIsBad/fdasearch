Proprietary Name: Diomed 15plus and Diomed 30plus Lasers
Common/Usual Name: Surgical Lasers
Classification Name: Laser Surgical Instruments
3. PREDICATE DEVICES
Diomed 15 and Diomed 30 Lasers -K962354
4. Device DESCRIPTION
The Diomed 1Splus and Diomed 30plus Lasers are modified versions of the
Diomed 15 and Diomed 30 lasers. A shorter pulse duration (50 ms) has been
added to both the 15plus and 30plus lasers. The modified devices include a spot
handpiece/software delivery system in addition to a fiber delivery system.
A Fluence Display has been added to enhance the efficiency of existing clinical
indications when using the spot hand piece. A power meter (currently used in the

Diomed 30 laser) has been added to the Diomed 15plus laser to improve the
accuracy of delivered powcr/flucnce to the treatment site.
5. INTENDED USE

The Diomed 15plus and 30plus Lasers are intended for use in delivering 15 or
30 watts of continuous wave radiation to a flexible optical fiber or spot hand piece
for use in ablation, incision, excision, coagulation, and vaporization of soft tissues
in open and endoscopic surgical procedures.

6. TECHNOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE
The Diomed 15plus and Diomed 30plus Lasers and the original Diomed 15 and
Diomed 30 Lasers all consist of a Class IV Gallium Aluminum Arsenide diode
lascr and a visible aiming beam. The original Diomed 15 and Diomed 30 lasers
offer a fiberoptic mode while the modified Diomed 15plus and Diomed 30plus
offers both a fiberoptic and spot handpiece mode.
The Diomed 15plus and Diomed 30plus Lasers and the Diomed 15 and Diomed
30 Lasers all have essentially identical performance characteristics except for
slight changes to the pulse duration. Both the Diomed 15plus and Diomed
30plus lasers and the predicate devices offer a fiberoptic mode. Additionally, the
proposed device offers a spot mode.

7. PERFORMANCE TESTING
Verification and validation testing was successfully performed to confirm that the
modified Diomed 15plus and Diomed 30plus Lasers function as intended.
