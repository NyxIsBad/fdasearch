A clinical Study under the supervision of a Health Care
practitioner (MD) was undertaken and shown to demonstrate
that the Tanda Skincare System can be used safely as a nonprescription device.
The Tanda Skincare System has undergone certification to IEC
60601-1. In addition, testing and analysis have demonstrated
compliance to ISO 10993 {Biocompatibility).
The ocular hazard level presented by unprotected exposure to
the Tanda Skincare light source was determine by applying the
calculations specified in Threshold Limit Values for Chemical .
Substances and Physical Agents & Biological Exposure Indices of
the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists
Worldwide and the standards of the International Commission on
Non-ionizing Radiation Protection. The results indicate that the
Tanda Skincare System - does not pose a risk of retinal injury due
to either the blue-light phototoxic effect, or the thermal damage
mechanism. In addition, there are no negative additive effects
from light exposure.

Dear Mr. Cascuna:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device .
