by Lumenis, Inc. Salt Lake City, Utah. The Novus® 3000 Ophthalmic Laser System with
Delivery Devices and Accessories share the same intended uses, indications for use and the
same or similar technological characteristics including: treatment wavelengths, laser active
medium, pumping system, aiming beam, mode of operation, exposure duration, power,
treatment intervals, spot sizes, controls and displays, laser energy delivery control (foot
switch), and delivery systems as the predicate devices identified above.
Device Description
Lumenis, Inc.’s Novus® 3000 Laser System with the Delivery Devices is an air cooled,
diode-pumped, solid state, Nd: YAG Laser System, which produces a wavelength of 532 nm
of laser light with a treatment beam output ranging from 50 mw to 3.0 W. The main parts of
the Novus® 3000 system include the laser console, a footswitch, a remote control and
assorted laser accessories.

Intended Use:
The Novus 3000 Laser System is intended for use in the treatment of ocular
pathology. The Novus 3000 Laser System is indicated for use in photocoagulation of
both anterior and posterior segments including:

e Retinal photocoagulation, panretinal photocoagulation and intravitreal
endophotocoagulation of vascular and structural abnormalities of the retina
and choroid including:

- proliferative and nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy;
- choroidal neovascularization;

- branch retinal vein occlusion:

- age-related macular degeneration;

- retinal tears, detachments;

- retinopathy of prematurity.

e Iridotomy, iridectomy and trabeculoplasty in angle closure glaucoma and

open angle glaucoma.
Laser Indirect Ophthalmoscope
The Laser Indirect Ophthalmoscope is indicated for the delivery of laser energy in eyes
with retinal pathology. The Laser Indirect Ophthalmoscope is indicated for use in the
following ophthalmic treatments and conditions: diabetic retinopathy (panretinal
photocoagulation); peripheral neovascularization, retinal breaks, detachments, and
tears, lattice degeneration, pneumatic retinopexy reattachment procedures, segmental
peripheral photocoagulation; segmental photocoagulation; cloudy vitreous cavities;
pediatric retinal repairs (under general anesthesia), delivery of laser energy through
small pupils or to eyes with focal lens opacities.
Endophotocoagulation
The Acculite EndoOcular Probe is indicated or use in the following ophthaimic
applications: photocoagulation of the anterior and posterior segment, including:
anterior segment treatment in the surgical management of glaucoma;
endophotocoagulation in vitreoretinal surgery, including panretinal
photocoagulation, retinopexy, and treatment of neovascularization.
The laser delivery function of the Acculite Acculite EndoOcular Probes (Acculite
EndoOcular Probe, Acculite Aspirating EndoOcular Probe and Acculite [luminating
EndoOcular Probe) is indicated for use in ocular surgery to deliver laser energy to the
treatment area selected by the surgeon.
The aspiration function of the Acculite Aspirating EndoOcular Probe is indicated for
use when unwanted fluid is present in the eye during ocular surgery, causing refraction
or scattering of the laser beam from the intended treatment site.
The illumination function of the Acculite Hluminating EndoOcular Probe is indicated
for use during ocular surgery to illuminate the interior of the eye.

Technological Characteristic Similarities
The Novus 3000 Laser System and Delivery Devices is similar in intended use and mode of
operation to the Lumenis Novus® Varia and the Lumenis Novus‘® Spectra. The Novus 3000
Laser Systern and Delivery Devices, the Novus Varia and the Novus Spectra all utilize a
trequency doubled ND:YAG, diode-pumped solid state system. The laser control system.
mode of operation, laser actuation, pulse counter, treatment intervals, aiming beam and the
exposure times, which are adjustable in variable increments, are the same for the predicate
devices as well as the Novus 3000® Laser System. In addition, the same Delivery Systems
are available for the predicate devices and the Novus 3000.
Performance Data:
No performance data is required for this Class II device nor requested by the Food and Drug
Administration (Office of Device Evaluation). No data was submitted for section 807.92
6[(b)(1)(2)Ge)].Conclusion:
The Novus® 3000™ with Delivery Devices is substantially equivalent to the Novus Varia
Ophthalmic Laser and Delivery Devices and the Novus Spectra Laser with Delivery Devices.
The Novus® 3000™ Laser with Delivery Devices share the same intended use, indications
for use, and technological characteristics as the predicate ophthalmic laser systems.

Dear Ms. Baker:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
