Common Name: Long Pulsed Nd:YAG and Alexandrite Surgical, Powered, Laser

I, Description
The DEPILASE TRIO LASE Laser System is based on Nd: YAG and Alexandrite laser
technology. Within the same system, one optical cavity contains the Nd: YAG crystal, and ~
another optical cavity contains the Alexandrite crystal, which are activated by means of the use
ofa flashlamp. After each cavity, a red diode aiming beam is reflected onto a coaxial beam path
using a beamsplitter assembly. The combined therapeutic and aiming beams are guided down an
individual optical fibre delivery system to a focusing handpiece. The laser is used in a noncontact mode.
The DEPILASE TRIO LASE Laser System is designed with 6 major sub-systems:
a) A high voltage power supply which converts and rectifies the a.c. mains current to
provide regulated power for the flashlamp simmer current and main triggering pulse.
b) A cooling system consisting of an internal water flow circuit together with water to air
heat exchanger.
c) An Nd: YAG laser rod, capable of generating optical pulses at a frequency up to 2 Hz.
d) An Alexandrite laser rod, capable of generating optical pulses at a frequency up to 2 Hz.
e) Two optical delivery systems, interfacing the energy from each laser cavity to the patient
via an indipendent optical fibre and focusing handpiece.
f) The microprocessor based controller which regulates the functions of the laser and allows
parameter selection by the user.

The DEPILASE TRIO LASE Laser System is indicated for the coagulation and haemostasis of
vascular lesions, the removal and permanent reduction of unwanted hair in Fitzpatrick skin types
I — VI, including suntanned skin and the dermatological applications for the non invasive
treatment of facial wrinkles
HI. Summary of Substantial Equivalence
Depilase believes that its DEPILASE TRIO LASE Laser System system is substantially
equivalent, regarding the Nd:YAG laser emission, to the Laserscope Lyra (K990718, K020021),
and Altus Medical Aesthetic CoolGlide (K991798) Nd: YAG Lasers previously cleared for both
the coagulation and hemostasis of vascular lesions, the removal and permanent reduction of
unwanted hair in Fitzpatrick skin types I — VI, including suntanned skin types and the non
invasive treatment of wrinkles, regarding the 532 nm laser emission to the Fotona Dualis KTP
(K011939), previously cleared for the coagulation and haemostasis of vascular lesions and
regarding the Alexandrite laser emission, to the Candela GenteLASE GL (K994260),
GenteLASE II (K984601) and the Cynosure Apogee TSK (K992757) Alexandrite lasers, all
previously cleared for the removal of unwanted hair in Fitzpatrick skin types I —- IV
They therefore have the same Intended Use as the DEPILASE TRIO LASE Laser System.
Technologically, the predicate devices have identical characteristics to the DEPILASE TRIO
LASE Laser System, all comprising a flashlamp pumped Nd: YAG laser rod generating light at a
wavelength of 1064 nm or 532nm, or a flashlamp pumped Alexandrite laser rod generating light
at a wavelength of 755 nm which is subsequently delivered to the patient via an individual
optical fibre delivery system and focusing handpiece.
The DEPILASE TRIO LASE Laser System output characteristics are very similar to those of
the predicate devices.
All lasers are microprocessor controlled devices.
All lasers utilize Class I aiming beams which pose no hazard to the user.
All systems utilize an internal closed loop water-air heat exchange circuit for optimal thermal
control of the laser cavity.
The risk and benefits of the DEPILASE TRIO LASE Laser System are comparable to the
predicate devices when used for similar clinical applications.
It is therefore believed that there are no new questions of Safety or Effectiveness raised by the
introduction of this device.

Dear Dr. Russo:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
