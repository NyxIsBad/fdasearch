Identification of Predicate Device
Predicate Device(s): Candela Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser, (Alexiazr), K063073

Device Description
The Candela Family of Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser (Alex_azr) systems consist of an
Alexandrite laser head, power supply and deionized water circulator. The Candela Family
of Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser (Alex_azr) systems also contains a Q-switching
mechanism which when disabled allows the laser system the capability of producing a
laser pulse duration of 0.050 — 0.120 millisecond. The laser head contains the cavity
mirrors, pockels cell, solid state laser medium (the Alexandrite rod), and two high
intensity xenon flashlamps which excite the laser medium. A calibration port with an
internal meter is located on the control panel, which is used to verify the transmission of
the optical fiber and handpiece, and to calibrate the output of the handpiece at selected
fluence levels. The temperature of the laser head is regulated by the circulation of
distilled water at a controlled temperature. The laser system is fully air cooled.

Lo7Is 2k, (agerg er
The Candela Family of Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser (Alexiaza) systems delivers laser
energy at a wavelength of 755 nm and pulse duration between 50 and 120 microseconds.
The output of this laser is delivered to the area of treatment by means of a lens coupled
user replaceable optical fiber with a treatment handpiece attached to its distal end. A
trigger switch ts used to control the delivery of pulses.
A microprocessor based system controller is used to monitor and direct all system
functions. Users of the laser select parameters such as desired energy density (fluence)
level and repetition rate and monitor operation via electronic controls and a display panel.
The conirol panel is also used to enable or disable the triggering of the laser, to initiate
the calibration feature and to obtain feedback from the system, such as the number of
pulses delivered or spot size selected. The Candela Family of Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser
(Alexzaze) systems support 2mm, 3mm, and 4mm nominal spot sizes.
Description of Intended Use
The Candela Family of Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser (Alexiazr) systems is indicated for
treatment in the following uses:
Pigmented Lesions
Tattoos
Rationale for Substantial Equivalence :
The Candela Family of Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser (Alex. az) systems, has the same intended
use, utilizes similar functional features (including power output, spot size, repetition rate, energy,
and fluence) and matches key design aspects (including wavelength, light generation medium,
power supply, cooling and controls system) , as the predicate devices.
The Candela Family of Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser (Alex. azr) systems shares similar methods
of assembly, method of operation, and intended uses, and therefore is substantially equivalent to
the current legally marketed Candela Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser, (Alex, azr), K063073,
Candela 3630 Laser Systems, Alexandrite, K063074 and Cynosure Apogee Elite Laser,
Alexandrite, K034030 predicate devices.
Safety and Effectiveness Information
The Candela Family of Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser (Alex.aza) systems is substantially
equivalent to the current legally marketed Candela Family of Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser
(Alexzazp) Systems, K063073, Candela 3630 Laser Systems, Alexandrite, K063074, and
Cynosure Apogee Elite Laser, Alexandrite, K034030 predicate devices in intended use and
technological features and therefore the risks and benefits are comparable to the predicate
devices.
We therefore believe that there are no new questions of safety or effectiveness raised by the
introduction of the Candela Family of Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser (Alex,azp) systems
Conclusion
Base on the similarities in indications for use, design features, and functional features the
Candela Family of Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser (Alex:azg) systems has been shown to be
substantially equivalent to the current legally marketed predicate devices.

Dear Mr, Roberts:

‘ We have reviewed your Section 510{(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The

. general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class IT (Special Controls) or class Il (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 — Mr. Jeffrey Roberts
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
. premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,

please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance
