Device Description: The laser device produces an invisible treatment beam for surgery and a
visible aiming beam. The pulsed Nd:YAG treatment beam is an invisible
beam of light (1064 nanometer wavelength); a Helium-Neon (HeNe)
laser within the laser head console supplies the red aiming beam. The
laser energy is developed inside an optical resonant cavity. A crystal rod
of neodymium-doped Yttrium Aluminum Garnet (pulsed Nd:YAG) is
placed between two mirrors. The rod is "pumped" by a flashlamp that
excites the Neodymium ions in the YAG crystal. Once excited,
stimulated emission of photons occurs. Laser energy exits the cavity
through a partially transmitting mirror and enters the distal end of the
contact fiber-optic cable at the aperture. The laser energy is transmitted
though the fiber-optic cable and exits the proximal tip of the fiber. The
device is controlled by microprocessor via keyboard access by the
operator, which allows various settings for energy levels, pulse widths
and repetition rates. Software controls preclude emission of laser
energy in any of a number of fault conditions.

Summary Rationale: | The SunLase 800P is a free running Nd:YAG laser based on the same
technology as the predicate Nd:YAG lasers listed above. In addition, the
predicate diode laser devices listed above operate clinically in substantially
equivalent fashion; their operational technology differs only by source of
emission, pulse rate, and wavelength. Tissue effects by predicate Nd:YAG
and diode devices exhibit identical physical characteristics. As such, the
indications for use and intended uses are the same. This consolidation of
clinical applications presents no new safety issues.

Intended Uses: The following are the oropharangeal indications for use for which the
device will be marketed:
+ Excisional and incisional biopsies
+ Excision and vaporization of herpes simplex | and {i
+ Exposure of unerupted teeth
+ Fibroma removal
* Frenectomy and Frenotomy
* Gingival troughing for crown impressions
+ Gingivectomy
+ Gingivoplasty
* Gingival incision and excision
+ Hemostasis
+ Implant recovery
+ Incision and drainage of abscess
+ Laser Assisted Uvulopaletoplasty (LAUP)
This laser is effective for cutting, ablating, coagulating and
removing oropharangeal soft tissue that has been
diagnosed as anatomically abnormal or naturally occurring
hypertrophic which has been identified and confirmed as
being associated with chronic palatal snoring.
* Leukoplakia
* Operculectomy
* Oral Papillectomies
« Pulpotomy and Pulpotomy as an adjunct to root canal therapy
+ Reduction of denture hyperplasia
* Reduction of gingival hypertrophy
+ Removal of filling material such as gutta percha or resin as
adjunct treatment during root canal therapy
+ Removal of post-surgical granulations
* Selective ablation of enamel (First Degree Caries Removal)
+ Soft tissue crown lengthening
+ Sulcular debridement or soft tissue curettage (removal of
diseased or inflamed soft tissue in the periodontal pocket to
improve clinical indices including gingival index, gingival
bleeding index, probe depth, attachment loss, and tooth mobility)
« Tissue retraction for impression
* Treatment of Apthous ulcers
« Vestibuloplasty

Dear Mr. Louisell:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801 and
additionally 21 CFR Part 809.10 for in vitro diagnostic devices), please contact the Office of
Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Additionally, for questions on the promotion and advertising of
your device, please contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4639. Also, please note the
regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97).
Other general information on your responsibilities under the Act may be obtained from the
Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number
