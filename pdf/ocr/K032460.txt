Device Trade Name: Profile BBL System

Common Name: Laser Powered Surgical Device (and Accessories)

Classification Name: Laser Surgical Instrument, 21 CFR 878.4810.

Legally Marketed Lumenis Family of Intense Pulsed-Light (KO30527,

Predicate Device: K020839)

Palomar EsteLux (K020453)
Altus Medical Coo!Glide with Optional Pulsed Light Hand
Piece (K023954)

Description of Profile BBL System emits intense wide spectrum

Profile BBL System: emission with wavelength of 500-1400 nm. It consists of a
system console, internal computer, control pane! and
display, and a treatment head comprised of a light guide
with cooling capability and a pushbutton switch.

Intended Use: The Profile BBL (and the light and/or laser delivery
accessories) is indicated for use in surgical, aesthetic and
cosmetic applications requiring selective photothermolysis
(photocoagulation or coagulation) and hemostasis of soft
tissue in the medical specialties of general and plastic surgery
and dermatology.

It is intended for use for:

« The treatment of tattoos;

« The treatment of benign pigmented lesions including
dyschromia, hyperpigmentation, melasma, ephelides
(freckles);

¢ The treatment of cutaneous lesions including warts, scars
and striae;

e The treatment of benign cutaneous vascular lesions,
including port wine stains, hemangiomas, facial, truncal and
jeg telangiectasias, rosacea, erythema of rosacea, engiomas
and spider angiomas, poikiloderma of Civatte, leg veins and
venous malformations;

¢ Treatment of psoriasis, vitiligo, atopic dermatitis (eczema),
seborrheic dermatitis; and

¢ The removal of unwanted hair from all skin types, and to

. effect stable long-term, or permanent, hair reduction.

The integral thermo-electric cooler is indicated for use in

cooling the epidermis at the treatment site prior to, during and :

after light or laser treatment in general surgery, plastic surgery

and dermatology to:

e Reduce pain during and/or associated with light or laser
treatment (via partial anesthesia from cooling);

« Reduce discomfort during and/or associated with light or
laser treatment:

« Minimize thermal injury, including thermal necrosis, to nontarget skin and skin structures during and/or associated with
light or laser treatment, thus reducing possible complications
such as scabbing, scarring, hyper- and/or hypopigmentation;

e Allow the use of higher light or laser fluences for light or
laser treatments (such as for hair removal and the treatment
of vascular or pigmented lesions); and

e Reduce potential side effects of light or laser treatments
(such as for hair removal and the treatment of vascular or
pigmented lesions).

Rationale for Substantial The Profile BBL Laser System shares the same
Equivalence: indications for use, similar design features (including
wavelength, laser medium, power supply, cooling and

control system), functional features (including power

output, repetition rate, energy, spot size and fluence), and

is therefore substantially equivalent to the above legally

marketed predicate devices.

Safety and Effectiveness The indications for use are based upon the indications for

Information use for predicate systems. Technologically, the Profile BBL
system is substantially equivalent to the listed predicate
devices. Therefore, the risks and benefits for the Profile

BBL system are comparable to the predicate devices.

Conclusion The Profile BBL shares similar indications for use, design
features, and similar functional features as, and therefore

is substantially equivalent to, the currently marketed

predicate devices.

Dear Mr. Patel:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration. listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class [If (PMA). it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition. FDA may

or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other l’ederal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
