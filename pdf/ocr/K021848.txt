Device Description:
General
This 510(k) submission is a modification of the existing Clarus Model 1150 Laser
Fiber previously filed as K922881 and found to be substantially equivalent by the
FDA on November 16, 1992. The original 510(k) device was a single-use,
straight firing laser fiber with a fiber indicated for laser disc decompression where
the laser is used to remove inner disc material. The laser fiber core ranges from
380 — 600 microns. ‘The modifications represented by this submission are the
addition of a reusable fiber, a side firing version (Model 1160), increased
indications for any soft tissue application for which Ho:YAG lasers have been
cleared, and an increased laser fiber core size range from 200 — 1000 microns.
Construction
The Model! 1150 Clarus Straight Firing Fiber is identical in materials, methods of
manufacture, sterilization, and dimensions to the currently marketed Clarus
Model 1150 Laser Fiber (K922881) with the following exceptions. These
exceptions are: making the fiber assembly reusable, increasing the range of the
laser fiber core size from 380 - 600 microns to 200 - 1000 microns, and the
indications for use. The distal end is polished flat and the laser energy is
transmitted in a forward direction. The low OHI fiber is terminated on the
proximal end with a standard compatible laser connector. These devices consist
of an optical fiber, which may be contained in a catheter tube, cannula, needle,
handpiece or handle.
The Model 1160 Clarus Side Firing Laser Fiber ts built identical to the Model
1150 Clarus Straight Firing Fiber listed above with the following exceptions. ‘The
exceptions being that the entire working length of the fiber is in a protective
sheath and the distal end is polished at an angle, and then terminated in a quartz
cap. The distal tip includes an exit beam indicator that is casily visible to the
operator when the fiber is placed through an endoscope. On the proximal end, the
low OH fiber is terminated with a standard compatible laser connector.
The Clarus Model 1150 Straight Firing and the Clarus Model 1160 Side Firing
Laser Fibers are supplied sterile (ETO) and are intended for reuse.
Use Of Laser Fiber with Delivery system
The Clarus Straight Firing and the Clarus Side Firing Laser Fibers may be used
both intraoperatively and percutancously through regulatory cleared delivery
systems.

Dear Mr. Barthel:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for

have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good
manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be
found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish

any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with
all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807);
labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality
systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation
control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
