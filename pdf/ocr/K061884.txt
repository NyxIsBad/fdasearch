510(k) SUMMARY (As Required per 21 CFR 807.92(c))

DEVICE OPERATION:
The Bovie ICON GI (the Generator) operates by delivering high frequency radiofrequency
(RF) energy which, when used in conjunction with other electrosurgical accessories, is used
to cut and coagulate tissue. There is a characteristic electrical wave form associated with each
mode. The electrical properties of the waveform (frequency and duration) produce the clinical
effect (ie. cut, coagulation). The shape and duration of waveforms are comparable between
the generator and predicate devices.
The Generator functions in any of seven user selectable modes:

a) Cut

b) Blend

c) Smart Cut

d) Pinpoint Coagulation

e) Soft Coagulation

f) Bipolar Coagulation

g) Gentle Bipolar Coagulation
The generator is designed to comply with applicable Medical Electrical Equipment safety
standards, including electromagnetic compatibility and other safety standards.
The Generator uses technology substantially equivalent to the predicate devices, the Aaron
IDS-300 (K022856) and the ERBE USA ERBOTOM ICC 200 (K933157). The generator
incorporates an ergonomically designed user interface screen for the selection of device
settings. Although different from the user interface of the predicate devices, the difference
does not affect the safety and effectiveness and may provide improved visualization of the
device settings.
There are no new hazards presented with the use of the Bovie ICON GI generator as
compared with the named predicate devices.
INTENDED USE:
The Bovie ICON GI Generator is used to deliver high frequency radiofrequency.
energy in conjunction with other surgical devices to cut and coagulate different kinds of
tissues.

Dear Mr. Kozloff:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for
use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce
prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good
manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be
found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 2!, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish
further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or
any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with
all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807);
labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality
systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation
control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
