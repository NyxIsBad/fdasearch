D. Summary Description of the Device
1. Summary
The Heat scissors system has been designed to cut and coagulate tissue for general
(open) abdominal surgery. This system consists of the Heat scissors generator, Heat
scissors handpiece and foot switch. This system uses direct thermal energy and
simultaneous pressure to cut and coagulate tissue. The thermal energy is generated at
the Heat-generating section of the blade, on the Heat scissors handpiece. It is conveyed
via a non-stick coating on the blade to the tissue.
2. Design
“Heat scissors system” has been designed, manufactured and tested in compliance with
voluntary safety standards. It meets the requirements of IEC 60601-1 and lEC60601-1-2.
3. Materials
The biocompatibility test reports of the above new materials show that such materials
complies with ISO 10993-1.
E. Intended Use of the device
- Heat scissors generator set
Heat scissors generator has been designed to generate electrical energy to the Heat
scissors handpiece to cut and coagulate body tissue.
- Heat scissors handpiece (XRF-940-M)
The Heat scissors handpiece has been designed to cut and coagulate body tissue in
general(open) abdominal surgery.
F. Reason for not requiring clinical data
When compared to the predicate devices, “Heat scissors system ” does not incorporate
any significant difference for safety and efficacy to the predicate devices.
Therefore, clinical data is not necessary for its evaluation of its safety and efficacy.

Dear Ms. Storms-Tyler:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
