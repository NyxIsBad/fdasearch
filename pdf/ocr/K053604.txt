2. Names
Device Name: IDAS
Classification Name: Laser Instrument, Surgical Powered
Product Code: GEX
Panel: Dermatology and Plastic Surgery
3. Predicate Devices
The IDAS laser system is substantially equivatent to the Laserscope laser
system AURA (K951034).
4. Device Description
The IDAS laser system (532 nm) is used for the treatment of superficial
vascular lesions and for pigmented lesions.
The laser radiation emitted by this type of laser system has a wavelength of
532 nm. Radiation of this wavelength is characterized by a particularly strong
absorption by hemoglobin and melanin. The radiation emitted by the laser
penetrates into the human skin 0.1 — 1 mm thus being able to locally heat up
even deeper-lying target structures which consequently leads to the desired
effect.

510(k) Summary of Safety and Effectiveness
~The laser system (532 nm) can be used in two different operating modes: In
the “cw” (= continuous wave) mode or in the “pulsed” operating mode.
Beam transmission is ensured by a fiber and a handpiece with different
adapters which are used to adjust the spot diameter on the skin. Beam
transmission, however, can be also effected via a bare fiber.
While the parameter wavelength is specified by the device, spot size, fluence
or power, pulse duration, frequency and the intensity of the aiming beam can
be selected by the treating physician for optimal adjustment to individual
requirements.
5. Indications for Use
The IDAS laser system is intended for use for
Aesthetics:
vascular lesions, spider veins, spider naevi, teleangiectasis, red superficial veins of
the legs and face, pigmented lesions (e.g. café-au-lait stains, lentigo), hemangiomas,
port wine stains, rosacea.
6. Performance Data
None presented.

Dated: February 2, 2006
Received: February 6, 2006
Dear Mr. Rongero:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class [I] (PMA),
it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device
can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA
may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 — Mr. Rongero
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your
. device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21 CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
