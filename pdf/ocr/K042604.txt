Intended Use: The Valley Forge Scientific Malis™ Bipolar Disposable Electro
Surgical Pen is indicated for use with the Valley Forge Scientific 300 Bipolar

System.

Device Description: Plastic disposable finger operated bipolar electro-surgical

instruments with either blade, ball or loop tips.

Performance Standards: Pursuant to Section 514 of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR
888, no performance standards have been established for this device
Substantial Equivalence:

The Valley Forge Scientific Malis bipolar instruments are similar in use to Bovietype mono-polar instruments which have been marketed for the past 25-30 years
(prior to May 28, 1976). Both the mono-polar and the bipolar instruments depend
on an electro-surgical generator to deliver RF current to the tips of the instruments
for cutting and coagulation.

The difference between the two methods can be found in the fact that with the
mono-polar systems, the current passes from an active electrode through the
patient to a grounding pad. The bipolar method eliminates the electrical current
being passed through the patient and the use of grounding pads and their inherent
safety hazards. Bipolar technology also permits the surgeon to work in a wet or
itrigated surgical field without current shunting.

The physical construction of both the mono-polar and bipolar instruments are
essentially identical. The switch mechanisms on both are liquid sealed with
buttons molded in place.

Dear Mr. Malis:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class HII (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

. This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
