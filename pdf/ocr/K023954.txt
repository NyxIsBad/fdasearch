V. Indications for Use

The family of Altus Medical CoolGlide Aesthetic Lasers with Optional Pulsed Light
Hand Piece are intended for use in the medical specialties of general and plastic surgery,
dermatology, endoscopic/laproscopic general surgery, gastroenterology, gynecology,
otorhinolaryngology (ENT), neurosurgery, oculoplastics, orthopedics,
pulmonary/thoracic surgery and urology for surgical and aesthetic applications.

Dermatology:

The Altus Medical Aesthetic CoolGlide laser systems are intended for the coagulation
and hemostasis of benign vascular lesions such as, but not limited to port wine stains,
hemangiomas, warts, telangiectasia, rosacea, venus lake, leg veins and spider veins. The
lasers are also intended for the treatment of benign pigmented lesions such as, but not
limited to, lentigos (age spots), solar lentigos (sun spots), café au lait macules, seborrheic
keratoses, nevi, chloasma, verrucae, skin tags, keratoses, tattoos(significant reduction in
the intensity of black and/or blue/black tattoos) and plaques.

Additionally, the lasers are indicated for pigmented lesions to reduce lesion size, for
patients with lesions that would potentially benefit from aggressive treatment, and for
patients with lesions that have not responded to other laser treatments.

The CoolGlide lasers are also indicated for the treatment of wrinkles such as, but not
limited to, periocular and periorbital wrinkles.

The CoolGlide lasers are also indicated for the removal of unwanted hair, for the stable
long term, or permanent, hair reduction through selective targeting of melanin in hair
follicles, and for the treatment for pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB).

The lasers are also indicated for the reduction of red pigmentation in hypertrophic and
keloid scars where vascularity is an integral part of the scar.

The CoolGlide lasers are indicated for use on all skin types (Fitzpatrick I-VD, including
tanned skin.

The intended use of the integral cooling system in the Altus handpiece is to provide
cooling of the skin prior to laser treatment, for the reduction of pain during laser
treatment, to allow for the use of higher fluences for laser treatments such as hair removal
and vascular lesions, and to reduce the potential side effects of laser treatments.

Optional Pulsed Light Hand Piece:

For the treatment of benign pigmented lesions.

Surgical Applications::
The lasers are indicated for the incision/excision and cutting, ablation,
coagulation/hemostatis of soft tissue in the performance of surgical applications in
endosopy/laproscopy, gastroenterology, general surgery, head and
neck/otorhinolaryngology (ENT), neurosurgery, oculoplastics, orthopedics,
plastic surgery, pulmonary/thoracic surgery, gynecology (e.g. menorrhagia) and
urology.

Indications for use (532nm):
For coagulation and hemostasis of vascular and cutaneous lesions in dermatology
including, but not limited to, the following general categories: vascular lesions
[angiomas, hemangiomas (port wine), telangiectasia (facial or extremities telangiectasias,
venous anomalies, leg veins)]; benign pigmented lesions (nevi, lentigines, chloasma,
café-au-lait, tattoos (red and green ink); verrucae; skin tags; keratoses; plaques; cutaneous
lesion treatment (hemostasis, color lightening, blanching, flattening, reduction of lesion
size).
VI. ‘Rationale for Substantial Equivalence
The family of Altus Medical CoolGlide Aesthetic Lasers with Optional Pulsed Light Hand
Piece shares the same general indications for use, and therefore is substantially equivalent
to the currently marketed :
VII. Safety and Effectiveness Information
The new indication for use in dermatology, specifically for the treatment of benign
pigmented lesions, is based upon the indications for use for predicate laser systems.
Technologically, the CoolGlide family of aesthetic lasers with optional pulsed light hand
piece is substantially equivalent to the listed predicate devices. Therefore the risks and
benefits for the CoolGlide laser family with optional pulsed light hand piece are
comparable to the predicate devices.
We therefore believe that there are no new questions of safety or effectiveness raised by
the introduction of this device.
VIII. Conclusion
The family of Altus Medical CoolGlide Aesthetic Lasers with Optional Pulsed Light Hand
Piece was found to be substantially equivalent to the currently marketed The family of
Altus Medical CoolGlide Aesthetic Lasers with Optional Pulsed Light Hand Piece shares
similar indications for use, design features, and similar functional features as, and thus are
substantially equivalent to, the currently marketed predicate devices.
