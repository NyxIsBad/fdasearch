5.9 Device Description
The McCUE Energist ULTRA VPL™ System is a light based medical device that
delivers a beam of pulsed non-ionising radiation in the region of 530nm to 950nm.
The system is designed to be compact and self contained and includes the following
features:
e Control console unit
e Display panel
e Power supply
e Cooling system
e¢ Removable handpiece with integrated switch, lamp, filter and glass coupling
block
5.10 Intended Use
The McCUE Energist ULTRA™ VPL Intense Pulsed Light System is intended for
permanent hair reduction and the treatment of mild to moderate inflammatory Acne
Vulgaris. It is also indicated for photocoagulation of dermatological vascular lesions,
photothermolysis of blood vessels and the treatment of benign pigmented lesions.
e [ntense Pulsed Light Energy / wavelengths (530 — 950nm)
The 530 — 950nm intense pulsed wavelengths are indicated for:
The treatment of mild to moderate inflammatory Acne Vulgaris.
The treatment of benign pigmented epidermal and cutaneous lesions
including warts, scars and striae.
The treatment of benign cutaneous vascular lesions including port
wine stains, hemangiomas, facial, truncal and leg telangiectasias,
rosacea, melasma, angiomas and spider angiomas, poikiloderma of
Civatte, leg veins, facial veins and venous malformations.

McCUE PLC McCUE Energist ULTRA VPL 510(k)
e Intense Pulsed Light Energy / wavelengths (610 — 950nm)
The 610 — 950nm intense pulsed wavelengths are indicated for:
The removal of unwanted hair from all skin types and to effect stable
long-term or permanent” hair reduction in skin types | — V through
selective targeting of melanin in hair follicles.
“' Permanent hair reduction is defined as a long-term stable reduction in the number
of hairs regrowing after a treatment regimen.
5.11 Comparison of Technological Characteristics
The McCUE Energist ULTRA VPL System has an identical intended use to the
McCue predicate system and identical technological characteristics except for
modifications to the device software and high voltage component. These differences
do not result in differences in performance or raise new questions of safety and
efficacy. The McCUE Energist ULTRA VPL System afso has the same principles of
operation, mode of action and equivalent energy outputs that are used by the Cyden
predicate device to achieve the treatment of Acne Vulgaris. Performance data was
provided to demonstrate that the system is capable of providing the outputs
necessary to achieve its required treatment parameters. The McCUE Energist
ULTRA VPL™ System is therefore concluded to be substantially equivalent to both
of the above named predicate devices and minor differences to the systems do not
raise additional concerns of safety and efficacy.

Dear Mr. Peach:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class If (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation contro! provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
