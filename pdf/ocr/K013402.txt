Device Modification
The VISULAS 532s laser represents an improved version of the
predicate Zeiss-Diode Pumped Solid State Laser (K925642).
: The improvement includes the following 2 modifications, which are detailed
introduced in the Special 510(k) - Device Modification description:
: " In addition to the known laser slit lamp, the slit lamp adapter
VISULINK 532/U or the Laser Indirect Ophthalmoscope LIO 532 may be
: used now as a laser application system.
« Laser console and user interface were improved to allow operation,
setting, and monitoring of the different laser treatment procedures.
Conclusion
The introduced side by side comparisons of the VISULAS 532s laser system
versus the predicate Zeiss-Diode Pumped Solid State Laser as approved with
the notification K925642 indicate that both devices are virtually identical
with exception of minor variations which are detailed introduced.
Also the additional applied delivery systems VISULINK 532/U and the
LIO 532 are very similar to the already used previously cleared
devices/accessories. In addition the delivery systems do not refer to any
other claims compared with the approved indications for use.
Thus the described device modification do not raise any new questions for
safety and efficacy and in the summary of the reviewed similarities and
. differences between the compared devices/accessories has to be concluded
that the VISULAS 532s may be applied by the surgeon after the modification
in a more state of the art way. .
Finally the renaming of the Zeiss-Diode Pumped Solid State Laser to
VISULAS 532s does not affect any question for safety and efficacy. The new
name is caused by the marketing strategy of the Carl Zeiss Jena GmbH,
Ophthalmic Instruments Division to use a concerted recognizable device
. name which distinguishes the laser treatment devices by the applied laser
wavelength.

Dear Mr. Nicoll:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and we have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the
indications for use stated in the enclosure) to devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to
May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have
been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
(Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices,
good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
