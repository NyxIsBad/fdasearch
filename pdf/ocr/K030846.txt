Contact Person: Lorraine Calzetta
Date prepared: June 09, 2003
Trade Name: Candela Smoothbeam Laser System
Common Name: Dermatology Laser System
Classification: Class II (21 CFR § 878.4810 Laser Surgical Instrument for use in
General and Plastic Surgery and in Dermatology)
Predicate Device: Laser Aesthetics CoolTouch (K022817) and Candela Mid IR Diode
Laser System aka Smoothbeam Laser (K022884)
Description:
The Diode laser is a continuous wave, diode medical laser, controlled by an embedded processor, to be
used for use in dermatology for treatment of periorbital wrinkles. The laser system operates with a
Dynamic Cooling Device, which provides a short burst of cryogen spray during the laser treatment. The
laser output energy is delivered via an optical fiber to a hand piece, which produces a circular beam on the
skin. The cryogen is delivered via a hose to a nozzle located in the hand piece. The Dynamic Cooling
Device functions to cool the skin during the laser treatment minimizing thermal damage to skin during laser
treatment and reducing pain associated with laser treatment.
The Candela Smoothbeam system is comprised of a power supply, optical delivery system, software
control system and Dynamic Cooling Device.
The Candela Smoothbeam Laser is equipped with safety interlock systems to protect patients and operators.
Users of the device make selections from a control panel to regulate operation during treatment.
Testing:
Asa laser product, the Smoothbeam Laser is required to conform and does conform to the Laser
Performance Standard (21 CFR 1040). In addition, the device conforms to the UL 544 electrical safety
standard and the Essential Requirements of the European Union Medical Device Directives.
Safety and Effectiveness information
The Smoothbeam Laser described in this submission is identical to the Smoothbeam laser cleared for the
Indications of treatment of periorbital winkles (K013825) and Atrophic acne scars (K022884) Candela
believes that no new issues of safety or effectiveness are raised by the introduction to market the
Smoothbeam Laser for the treatment of facial winkles.

Summary of Substantial Equivalence:

The indication for use for the treatment of facial wrinkles is based on substantial equivalence to the Cool
Touch Laser, which is cleared for use for the treatment of fine lines and wrinkles (K022817). Additionally,
the Candela Smoothbeam Laser utilizes the identical or similar operating principles, matches key design
aspects, including same spot size, same of similar wavelength and same maximum delivered power as the
predicate devices. On this basis, Candela believes that the Candela Smoothbeam Laser System is
substantially equivalent to the predicate devices for the same indications for use.
