Intended for general surgical applications; dermatology/plastic surgery;
endoscopic/laparoscopic surgery; general surgery; gynecology; ENT; hemostasis;
neurosurgery; oculoplastics; pulmonary surgery; thoracic surgery; urology; and
orthopedics.
General Surgical Applications:

Se ko 2 foy
Incision, excision, coagulation, hemostasis, vaporization, and/or ablation of soft tissue in
dermatology/ plastic surgery, endoscopic/laparoscopic general surgery, gastroenterology,
general surgery, gynecology, head and neck/-otorhinolaryngology (ENT), neurosurgery,
oculoplastics, orthopedics, pulmonary surgery, thoracic surgery and urology.
Dermatology/Plastic Surgery:
Coagulation and hemostasis of benign vascular lesions such as, but not limited to, port
wine stains, hemangiomas, warts, telangiectasia, rosacea, venus lake, leg and spider
veins and poikiloderma of Civatte and treatment of benign cutaneous lesions such as
warts, scars, striae and psoriasis . It addition, the laser is intended for the treatment of
benign pigmented lesions such as, but not limited to, lentigos (age spots), solar lentigos
(sun spots), cafe au lait macules, seborrheic keratoses, nevi, chloasma, verrucae, skin
tags, keratoses, tattoos (significant reduction in the intensity of blue and/or black
tattoos), and plaques.
The ULTRAWAVE II EX 1320 laser is also indicated for pigmented lesions to reduce
lesion size, for patients with lesions that would potentially benefit from aggressive
treatment, and for patients with lesions that have not responded to other laser
treatments.
The ULTRAWAVE II EX 1320 laser is also indicated for the treatment of facial wrinkles
and wrinkles such as, but not limited to, periocular and periorbital wrinkles.
The ULTRAWAVE II EX 1320 is indicated for the removal of unwanted hair, for the stable
long-term, or permanent, hair reduction through selective targeting of melanin in hair
follicles, and for the treatment of pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB).
The ULTRAWAVE H EX 1320 is indicated for the reduction of red pigmentation in
hypertrophic and keloid scars where vascularity is an integral part of the scar.
The ULTRAWAVE H EX 1320 is indicated for use on all skin types (Fitzpatrick I-VI}
including tanned skin, and the removal and permanent reduction of unwanted hair in
Fitzpatrick I-VI, including suntanned skin types.
Orthopedics:
Cutting, ablation, and/or hemostasis of intra-articular tissue in orthopedic surgical and
arthroscopic applications.
Pulmonary Surgery:
Palliative treatment of benign and malignant pulmonary airway obtructions, including
squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, carcinoid, benign tumors, granulomas, and
benign strictures.
Thoracic Surgery:
Incision, excision, coagulating and vaporization of soft tissue. Thoracic applications,
including but not limited to, isolation of vessels for endarterectomy and/or by-pass
grafts, wedge resections, thoractomy, formation of pacemaker pockets; vaporization,
coagulation, incision/excision, debulking, and ablation of lung tissue (thoracoscopy).

ko70 fe A
Urology:
All applications including superficial urinary bladder tumors, invasive bladder
carcinoma, urethral strictures and lesions of the external genitalia (including condyloma
acuminate) .
Nd:YAG 1320nm
Indicated for use in general surgery and dermatology for the incision, excision, ablation,
vaporization, coagulation and haemostasis of soft tissue. It is also indicated for the
treatment of periorbital and perioral wrinkles, fine lines and wrinkles, and the treatment
of back acne and atrophic acne scars.
Alexandrite 755nm
Intended for coagulation and hemostatis of vascular lesions and the removal and
permanent reduction of unwanted hair in Fitzpatrick skin types I-VI, including
suntanned skin types. Also indicated for pigmented lesions and wrinkles.
IPL

590-1200nm ; 625-1200nm; 650-1200nm
Indicated for permanent hair reduction.
550-1200nm ; 5'70-1200nm
Indicated for photocoagulation of dermatological vascular lesion { i.e.,face telangiectasia),
photothermolysis of blood vessels (treatment of facial and leg veins), and treatment of
benign pigmented lesions.
400-1200nm
Indicated for inflammatory acne (acne vulgaris).
Integrated Skin Cooler
The intended use of the integrated cooling system in the ULTRAWAVE II EX 1320 hand
piece is to provide cooling of the skin prior to laser treatm ent, for the reduction of pain
during laser treatment, to allow for the use of higher fluencies for laser treatments such
as hair removal and vascular lesion, and to reduce the potential side effects of laser
treatments.
Any other different use is considered incorrect.
Technological Characteristics

The ULTRAWAVE II FX 1320 consists of two laser sources and an IPL. The laser

sources emit wavelengths of 1064nm,1320nm for the Nd:YAG source and 755nm

for the Alexandrite source. The IPL has several different ULTRAWAVE II FX 1320

includes a power supply; a cooling system; an optical delivery system; a

microprocessor based controller; an integral skin cooler; and safety features to

ensure use of the appropriate laser, wavelen gth and hand piece.

None.

Substantial Equivalence
The ULTRAWAVE II FX 1320 is as safe and effective as the predicate devices. The
ULTRAWAVE II FX 1320 has the same intended uses and similar indications,
technological characteristics, and principles of operation as its predicate device.
The minor technological differences between the ULTRAWAVE II FX 1320 and its
predicate devices raise no new issues of safety or effectiveness. Thus, the
ULTRAWAVE II FX 1320 is substantially equivalent.

Dear Mr. Kahan:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for
use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce
prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good
