Predicate Device(s) OO “t q
K051168 HALO2® Coagulation Catheter-BARRX Medical Inc.
K050831 Stellartech Coagulation Catheter 2-Stellartech Research
Corporation
Intended Use / Indications for Use
The HALO20 Coagulation System intended use is for the coagulation of bleeding
and non-bleeding sites in the gastrointestinal tract.
The HALO®° Coagulation System is indicated for use in the coagulation of bleeding
and non-bleeding sites in the gastrointestinal tract including but not limited to, the
esophagus. Indications include Esophageal Ulcers, Mallory-Weiss tears,
Arteriovenous Malformations, Angiomata, Barrett’s Esophagus, Dieulafoy Lesions,
and Angiodysplasia.
Technological Characteristics
The HALO2 Coagulation System consists of the HALO Coagulation Generator
with a disposable single-use HALO2° Coagulation Catheter, output cable, and an
optional footswitch. The HALO? Coagulation Catheter performance and mode of
operation is substantially equivalent to the already cleared HALO%® Coagulation
Catheter and Stellartech Coagulation Catheter 2 manufactured by Stellartech
Research Co.
Substantial Equivalence
The HALO? Coagulation Catheter manufactured by BARRX Medical Inc and the
predicate devices: HALO%° Coagulation catheter and Stellartech Coagulation
Catheter 2 have the same intended use, indications for use, technological
characteristics, and principles of operation. The technological differences between
the HALO3® Coagulation System and its predicates are: (1) increase in balloon
length for improved manufacturability; (2) increase in the electrode liner; non active
surface for improved manufacturability, (3) changes in materials; (4) changes to the
instructions for use for clarity; and (5) change in the manufacturing location. All
these differences were evaluated on bench and did not raise questions regarding
safety and efficacy. Thus the devices are equivalent.

Dear Ms. Filimon:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for
use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce
prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good
manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class If (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be
found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish
further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or
any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with
all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807);
labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality
systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation
control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050. This letter will allow you to
begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA
