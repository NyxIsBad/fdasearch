Identification of Legally Marketed Predicate Devices

SharpLight - BEAMAX Pulse Light System - K063249

Device Description

The proposed BEAMAX/ FORMAX family system is a pulsed light energy device based on a
filtered, Xenon flashlamp.

The total emission spectrum of a Xenon flashlamp is from around 300 nm in the UV to 1000 nm
in the near IR. The light emitted from the lamp is collected by a reflector and focused into a
rectangular, waveguide. Prior to entering the waveguide, the light is transmitted through a longpass optical filter which blocks all wavelengths below the “cut-off” wavelength of the filter. Thus
when a 635nm filter is used, only light of wavelengths above 635 nm is emitted. Since the lamp is
surrounded by-a water cooling jacket, actual wavelength emission is up to about 950 nm, due
water absorption of longer wavelengths,
The BEAMAX/FORMAX family system is equipped with four different handpieces which can be
attached for different clinical applications. These handpieces differ in the optical filter applied,
hence in the optical spectrum emitted, as well as in the time duration of the pulses emitted.
A microprocessor based system controller is used to monitor and direct all system functions and
Man Machine Interface.

Intended Use of Device

The BEAMAX/ FORMAX Pulsed Light Device Family and optional Handpies family are
intended for usc in aesthetic and cosmetic applications and in selective treatments required in the
medical specialties of dermatology.

The BEAMAX/ FORMAX Pulsed Light Device Family and optional Handpies family with 415 —
950 nm wavelengths (with and without contact-cooling) are indicated for:

* Hair removal in all skin types to the Fitzpatrick scale. Permanent Hair Reduction.

* Treatment of Vascular Lesions

* Treatment of Inflammatory Acne (acne vulgaris)

* Treatment of Benign Pigmented Epidermal and Cutaneous Lesions including warts, scars and
striae.

Safety & Effectiveness ,

The intended use and indications of the submitted BEAMAX/ FORMAX pulsed light system
family is identical to the legally marked devices: BEAMAX (K063249 - for hear removal
treatments); Harmony XLTm Multi-Application Platform (K072564); Cutera Optional Pulsed
Light Hand Piece Family (K050047).

Similarity of intended use and intended use and technological features and therefore the risks and
benefits are comparable to the predicate devices.

We therefore believe that there are no new questions of safety or effectiveness raised by the
introduction of sharpLight's BEAMAX/ FORMAX Fluorescent Pulsed Light Systems.

Rational for Substantial Equivalency

Similarities:

The intended use and indications of the proposed modified BEAMAX/ FORMAX device family
are similar to the legally marketed predicate devices.

The technology, performance and most of the specifications of the proposed modified BEAMAX/
FORMAX device family are similar to the legally marketed predicate devices

Differences:

The proposed modified device family includes wider indications in reference to legally marked
BEAMAX (K063249) indication for use that is limited to Hair removal only.

The proposed device family intended use and indications for use are similar to the IPL intended
and indications for use of Harmony XLTm Multi-Application Platform (K72564) and Cutera
Optional Pulsed Light Hand Piece Family (K050047) predicate devices (Other indications are
related to optional Laser handpieces).

Substantial Equivalence Statement

Bascd on the above, it is Sharp|_ight's opinion that the proposed BEAMAX and FORMAX Pulsed
Light Device Family is substantially equivalent in terms of design, functional features and safety
& effectiveness to the unmodified BEAMAX (K63249) legally marketed device and to the legally
marked predicate devices.

Dated: October 15, 2008

Received: October 21, 2008
Dear Ilan Sharon:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115, Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance
