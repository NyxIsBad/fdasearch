Conclusion:

IPL™ Quantum has a broader range of applications than Ellipse 7PL. IPL™ Quantum may be
updated with a Laser module for vascular treatment applications in addition to the IPL
modules. Ellipse PPL does not employ a Laser module, only IPL. Ellipse PPL thus utilizes a
subset of the IPL™ Quantum applications.

SkinStation™ has identical range of applications as Ellipse ’PL, and the intended use and the
performance is substantially equivalent.

EsteLux'™ has a broader range of applications than Ellipse PPL, the intended use for Eipse
FPL is covered by the EsteLux™ and the performance is substantially equivalent.

The systems and identical application modules utilized by IPL™ Quantum (Lumenis, Inc.),
Skin Station™ (Radiancy Ltd.) , and EsteLux™ (Palomar) have been evaluated and compared
to Ellipse PPL. The Ellipse ?’PL system, as far as these identical modules, applications and
intended uses are concemed, are judged to be substantially equivalent to the IPL™ Quantum
(predicate device cleared in K024093, K020839), SkinStation™ (predicate device cleared in
K030897), and EsteLux™ (predicate device cleared in K991935, K984110).

Based on this analysis of the overall performance characteristics of the mentioned predicate
devices Danish Dermatologic Development A/S believes that no significant differences exist.
The Ellipse ’PL system should not raise new issues of safety and effectiveness and is judged
to be substantially equivalent to the mentioned predicate devices.
