SECTION 11 SUMMARY OF SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS

INTRALASE FS Laser is achieved through precise individual micro
photodisruptions of tissue, created by tightly focused ultrashort pulses which are

delivered through a disposable applanation lens while fixating the eye under very

low vacuum.
5. STATEMENT OF INTENDED USE:

The INTRALASE FS is an ophthalmic surgical laser indicated for use in the

creation of a corneal flap in patients undergoing LASIK surgery or other

treatment requiring initial lamellar resection of the cornea.
6. STATEMENT OF HOW THE TECHNOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DEVICE

COMPARE TO THOSE OF THE PREDICATE OR LEGALLY MARKETED DEVICE.

The technological characteristics of the INTRALASE FS Laser have already

been cleared under K013941 for lamellar corneal resections. The slight changes

made to the technological characteristics of the Laser do not alter the

performance or indication of this device.
7. BRIEF SUMMARY OF NONCLINICAL TESTS AND RESULTS:

The INTRALASE FS Laser has undergone testing and is in compliance with

applicable safety standards. In addition, the INTRALASE FS was found to

perform equivalently to the predicate Laser, with respect to the creation of

corneal resections in extensive ex vivo and in vivo studies. Thus, the

INTRALASE FS Laser and the predicate device have similar safety,

effectiveness or performance profiles.

Dear Dr. Gordon:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class I (Special Controls) or class [1] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determinatidn does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

, This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
“Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
