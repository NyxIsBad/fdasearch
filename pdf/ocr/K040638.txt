Device Information:
Classification: Class Il
Trade Name: VNUS Radiofrequency Generator, Model RFG2
Classification Name: Electrosurgical Device
Predicate Device(s)
VNUS RF Generator models RF-110 and RF-220 cleared as a part of the VNUS® Closure®
System (K982816, KO003092, and K030557), and VNUS Vessel and Tissue Coagulation
System (K0033547)
Device Description:
The VNUS RF Generator, model RFG2 is a bipolar, high frequency electronic,
microprocessor / software controlled instrument. It allows the user to set Power,
Temperature and Time values, and provides user displays of Power, Temperature and Time
(set-points and measured values) as well as measured Impedance and user messages.
The RF Generator remains out of the sterile field during use, and is provided non-sterile.
The mode! RFG2 is compatible only with the disposable RF delivery devices (e€.g.,
catheters) designed, manufactured and marketed by VNUS Medical Technologies under
separate clearance(s).
The instrument cable connects the disposable device to the RF generator. The Instrument
Cable is provided non-sterile, and is user sterilizable by autoclave. It has been validated to
multiple steam sterilization cycles. Both ends of the cable are identical to eliminate
connection errors. If the VNUS RF delivery device has an integrated cable, a separate
instrument cable is not necessary.
Intended Use:
The VNUS Radiofrequency Generator is intended for use with VNUS radiofrequency
devices intended for vessel and tissue coagulation.

“NUS Radiofrequency Generator. Model RFG2 510(k) Notification
Intended Use of Predicate Devices
The specified predicate devices are indicated for “coagulation of blood vessels in patients
with superficial vein reflux” (VNUS Closure System), and “vessel and tissue coagulation”
(VNUS Vessel and Tissue Coagulation System).

Technological Comparison

The RF energy is widely used in electrosurgical equipment for many years. The safety and
efficacy of such devices has been well established for a variety of intended uses. The use of
bipolar RF energy delivery has potential advantages over monopolar systems. No

grounding pads are required, and the potential for damage to adjacent tissue is minimized,
as the patient is no longer the return path for electrical current. The efficiency of bipolar RF
energy delivery allows systems such as the VNUS RF Generator to be used at lower

voltage and power settings as compared with monopolar systems.

The technological characteristics and principals of operation of the VNUS RF Generator,
mode! RFG2 are substantially equivalent to the noted predicate devices.

Test Results:

Performance

Results of in-vitro testing will demonstrate that the VNUS Radiofrequency Generator is safe
and effective for its intended use.

Summary of Safety and Effectiveness

Based upon the design, materials, function, intended use, comparison with currently
marketed devices and the non-clinical testing performed by VNUS, it is concluded that the
VNUS Radiofrequency Generator, Model RFG2 (proprietary name: TBD) is substantially

equivalent to the noted predicate devices in safety and effectiveness.

Trade/Device Name: VNUS Radiofrequency Generator, Model RFG2
Regulation Number: 21 CFR 878.4400
Regulation Name: Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation device and accessories
Regulatory Class: Il
Product Code: GEI
Dated: March 8, 2004
Received: March 10, 2004
Dear Mr. Nanavati:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
if your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 - Mr. Sam Nanavati :
This letter will allow you to begin marketing yourdevice as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
“"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
