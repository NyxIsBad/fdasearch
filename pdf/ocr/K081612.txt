Product trade mame: Aesculight family of fibers, handpieces, and tips for CO, surgical lasers

Product common mame: Laser flexible fibers, handpieces, and tips

Classification mames: General and Plastic Surgery Devices, 21 CFR, 878.4810, product

code GEX; ENT Microsurgical CO2 Laser, 21 CFR874.4500, product code EWG; Gynecologic

Surgical Laser, 21 CFR 884.4550, product code HHR; Soft Tissue Dental Laser, 21 CFR 878.4810,

product code NVK

Legally marketed predicate device: Modified LX-20 Laser System fibers, handpieces,

and tips, as described in 510(k) no. K960475

Product description

This is a family of detachable devices that comprise the distal portion of a beam delivery system to

be used with a CO, surgical laser such as that described in K96075. Specifically, the devices consist

of a flexible hollow lightpipe (fiber), handpieces that connect to the fiber, and various tips that

connect to the handpieces. The tips are short, rigid hollow alumina lightpipes producing a variety

of spot sizes. The user may “mix and match” handpieces and tips to suit the clinical task at hand.

Intended use

The intended use of the product(s) is to communicate the laser beam of a CO, surgical laser to the

target site for the incision, excision, ablation, or photocoagualtion of soft tissue. Representative

examples of clinical applications include:

Gynecology--excision and vaporization of cervical, vulvar, and perineal condyloma: ablation of vaginal and

vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia; herpes vaporization; vaporization of urethral caruncle; 1&D Bartholin’s and

nubothian cysts

Dermatology--port wine hemangioma removal; rhinophyma reduction; telangiectasia removal; wart
removal; basal squamous cell carcinomoa removal; blepharoplasty, xanthalasma removal; removal of
neurofibromas hemangiomas, nevi, and tircoeptiheliomas; dermabrasion for lentigos, keratoses, actinic
keratosis and actinic chleilitis
Dentistry/Oral Surgery--gingivectomy; frenum release; gingivoplasty; removal of soft tissue, cysts, and
tumors
General Surgery--hemorrhoid removal; skin tag vaporization; pilodidal cyst removal and repair;
debridement of decubitus ulcers and stasis ulcers; mastectomy; breast biopsy, reduction mammoplasty;
cytoreduction for metastatic disease; many dermatological procedures
Laparoscopic Surgery--vaporization, incision, excision, ablation, or photo-coagulation of soft tissue such as
endometriosis ablation, excision of adhesions, salpingotomy
Otorhinolaryngology--lymphangioma removal; turbinectomy, subglottic stenosis vaporization,
tonsilectomy, removal of vocal cord papillomas, nodules, and polyps
Podiatry--plantar wart vaporization; fungal nail treatment; partial and complete matrixectomy;
porokeratoma ablation; Morton’s neurome removal; ingrown toenail treatment
Orthopedic--menisectomy, chondromalacia abalation, partial synovectomy, lateral release, PMMA
removal
No new indications for use are sought beyond those associated with the predicate devices. :
Technological characterization
When used with a CO, laser, the effect on tissue of the laser beam, as produced by the Aesculight
family of products, is identical to that of the predicate products. The Aesculight tips produce the
same range of spot sizes as the predicate tips. Cosmetically, dimensionally, and ergonomically, the
Aesculight products are very similar to the predicates, and use the same optical principles to
conduct the laser light from the base unit to the target site. There are, in some cases however,
some differences in construction. The predicate fiber is based upon an optically-coated (for
enhanced reflectivity) molybdenum ribbon formed into a long skinny tube (with the optical
coating on the inside surface), whereas the Aesculight fiber is based upon internally-coated
flexible seamless tubing. This tubing, with no seams or gaps in the optical coating, exhibits
somewhat better transmission efficiency than the predicate fiber. While some of the Aesculight
tips are identical in construction to the predicate tips, some are not. To produce the smaller spot
sizes, the predicate tips use a cone of coated molybdenum ribbon to concentrate the beam,
whereas the Aesculight tips are monolithic alumina with a conical lumen. The alumina tips are
capable of sustaining higher power throughputs than the predicate foil tips. These differences in
construction do not introduce any new safety or performance concerns.

Page 5-2

The Aesculight handpieces, for the most part, exhibit only minor cosmetic differences to the
predicate handpieces. In one case (the backstop handpiece), the Aesculight handpiece is a
shorter version of the predicate, and in other cases, Aesculight produces more handpiece models
with integral or add-on smoke evacuation capabilities, but these differences merely affect the
convenience of use of the handpieces, and have no effect on the laser beam-tissue interaction.
Conclusion
The Aesculight fiber, although differing somewhat in construction, has very similar physical and
optical characteristics as the predicate fiber. Both are flexible, optically multi-mode, hollow
lightpipes, and both have the same lumen size and length, with the Aesculight version exhibiting
superior transmission efficiency. In some cases, the Aesculight handpieces are almost identical to
the predicate handpieces; in other cases, the Aesculight handpieces are simple mechanical
modifications of the predicate handpieces with the object of providing more convenience for the
user. The Aesculight tips are, in some cases, exactly identical to the predicate tips; in other cases,
the construction (but not the internal geometry) differs from the predicates, and laboratory bench
testing confirms that the spot sizes produced by the Aesculight tips are identical to the predicate
tips, that the Aesculight tips have similar transmission efficiencies as the predicate tips and have
power-handling capabilities that equal or exceed those of the predicate tips. From a clinical
efficacy standpoint, a user could not distinguish a difference between the predicate products and
the Aesculight products, nor do the Aesculight products raise any new safety issues.

Dear Mr. Diaz:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications

: for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,

, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and-prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class Ii] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can

: be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
