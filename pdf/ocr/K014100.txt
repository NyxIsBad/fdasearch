tissue. This is a dual laser system incorporating an Er: YAG laser and a CO; laser.

The system is operating at a wavelength of 2.94 microns and 10.6 microns

respectively. The Er: YAG laser delivers to the tissue pulses with energies up to 1

joule per pulse and power up to 12 Watts. . The CO; laser delivers to the tissue

power in continuous mode (CW) up to 10 Watts and pulses (SP) up to 6 Watts.

Substantial Equivalence:

The Opus Spectrum dental laser system is substantially equivalent to the Opus 20

dental laser system (OpusDent Ltd.). In fact, it is an improved model of Opus 20

that is similar to its predicate device except the following features:

¢ Opus Spectrum software runs on Window NT® Operating System while
Opus 20 incorporates a stand-alone software.

¢ Opus Spectrum incorportes an On Line Monitor that monitors the Er:YAG
lasing power in addition to the two power meters in Opus 20.

¢ Opus Spectrum has two masts - one for Er:YAG and one for CO2. Opus 20
has one mast for both lasers.

¢ Additional safety feature was added to Opus Spectrum. A microswitch is
located in each handpiece carrier to indicate the handpiece in use and to
identify miscorrelation between handpiece and desired laser mode.

¢ Opus Spectrum has external cooling system that cools the coolant of the
internal cooling systems while Opus 20 has internal water/air cooling system.

‘ ¢ Opus Spectrum incorporates a new power supply.

You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
