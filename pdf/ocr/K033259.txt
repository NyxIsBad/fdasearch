energy is emitted at 1064 nanometers in the near-infrared portion of the spectrum. With
the optional frequency doubler installed, a 532nm beam is emitted. The 532nm emission is
visible green light. Energy from the laser is delivered directly to the target area via the
handpiece, which produces a circular beam on the skin. A red aiming beam is provided to
allow the operator to precisely target the treatment area. The Q-Clear™ Laser is equipped
with safety features in conformance with 21CFR Part 1040.
Intended Use:
The Light Age Q-Clear™ Laser is intended for the following uses:
1. For incision, excision, ablation, and vaporization of soft tissue for General Dermatology
2. The 1064nm wavelength is indicated for:
~ Dark ink tattoo removal
_ Treatment of pigmented lesions (particularly Nevus of Ota)
— Removal or lightening of hair
_ Skin resurfacing with or without adjuvant preparation
- Treatment of common nevi
3. The 532nm wavelength is indicated for:
— Removal of light ink (red, tan, purple and orange) tattoos
- Treatment of common nevi
- Treatment of café-au-lait spots
- Treatment of seborrheic keratoses
Treatment of vascular lesions, including facial and leg veins, tclangiectasias,
angiomas, hemangiomas, port wine stains, and most pi gmented lesions (e.g.
lentigines, and ephelides)
Safety and Effectiveness:
The Light Age Q-Clear™ Laser has the same wavelengths, the same spot size, the same
principle of operation, essentially the same fluence levels, and the same intended use as the
predicate devices. The Light Age Q-Clear™ Laser does not raise new questions of safety
or efficacy, and is substantially equivalent to the predicate devices.
