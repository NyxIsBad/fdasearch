Summary Prepared: December 20, 2006
Trade Name: UniBlate Electrosurgical Device
Common Name: Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation device and accessories
Classification: Class Il per 21 CFR 878.4400
Product Code: GEl
Predicate Devices: StarBurst XLi (KO10060)

Cool-Tip RF System (K984552)
Intended Use:
The RITA Medical Systems UniBlate Electrosurgical Device is intended to coagulate tissue during
percutaneous, laparoscopic, and intraoperative surgical procedures.
Description:
The UniBlate Electrosurgical Device is a monopolar radiofrequency (RF) device that consists of a
variably insulated electrode. The instrument has an attached electrical cable and infusion tubing
set which connects the device directly to the RITA Medical 1500X RF generator and the
IntelliFlow peristaltic pump respectively. The electrical cable provides RF energy and temperature
feedback to the generator and the pump infuses normal saline through the infusion tubing set.
The UniBlate Electrosurgical Device is a single use device.
Technological Differences:
The RITA UniBlate, RITA StarBurst XLi (KO10060) and Radionics Cool-Tip (K984552) are monopolar
electrodes used to deliver RF energy during open, laparoscopic or percutaneous procedures to ablate
and coagulate soft tissue. The UniBlate and StarBurst XLi devices are designed to provide a
scaleable coagulation zone. The UniBlate electrode has a single active electrode that can be exposed

from 1 cm to 3 cm by retracting an insulating sheath. The StarBurst XLi consists of multiple
electrodes which are deployed into the tissue from an insulated trocar. The Cool-Tip has a fixed
length active electrode, but is available in different sizes. Both the UniBlate and StarBurst XLi allow
for local fluid delivery as well as temperature monitoring. The UniBlate Electrosurgical Device is
similar to the predicate RITA StarBurst XLi and Radionics Cool-Tip in principles of operation and
construction and has the same intended use as the Coo!-Tip.
Performance Data:
Performance testing was done to ensure that the UniBlate Device functions as intended and meets
design specifications. Sufficient data was obtained to show that the device is substantially equivalent
to the predicate device, and meets safety and effectiveness criteria.

Regulation Name: Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation device and accessories

Regulatory Class: Class II

Product Code: GEI

Dated: January 29, 2007

Received: January 30, 2007
Dear Mr. Christensen:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with al] the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115 Also, please note the regulation entitled,
