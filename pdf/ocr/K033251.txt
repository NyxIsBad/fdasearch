Laser System & Accessories (Nd:YAG configuration) (k990903 and k020021), Sciton image
Hair Removal Nd:YAG Laser (k012552). The FriendlyLight® Nd:YAG Lasers have the
same intended use and general and specific indications as the predicated CoolGlide® devices.
‘These devices have very similar principles of operation and technological characteristics. The
minor technological differences do not raise any new questions of safety and effectiveness.
Performance data demonstrates that F riendlyLight® Nd:YAG Lasers are as safe and effective as
the predicated devices.
4. Device Description:
The FriendlyLight® Nd:YAG Laser consists of a power supply unit, an air-cooling system, a foot
switch, and the hand piece that connects the laser unit and power supply/air-cooling system using
an umbilical cord. In standard use, the hand piece is held against the treatment area and the light
pulse is delivered when the foot switch and/or hand switch is depressed. Laser parameters and
other system features are controlled from a display panel located on the front of the power supply
unit.
5. Intended Use/Indications for Use:

The FriendlyLight® Nd:YAG Lasers are intended to be used in the medical specialties of
general and plastic surgery, dermatology, endoscopic/laproscopic general surgery,
gastroentermology, gynecology, otorhinolaryngology (ENT), neurosurgery, oculaplastics,
orthopedics, pulmonary/thoracic surgery and urology for surgical and aesthetic applications.

treatment of benign cutaneous lesions, such as warts, scars, striae, and psoriasis. The lasers are
also intended for the treatment of benign pigmented lesions such as, but not limited to, lentigos
(age spots), solar lentigos (sun spots), café au lait macules, seborrheic keratoses, nevi, chloasma,
verrucae, skin tags, keratoses, tattoos (significant reduction in the intensity of black and/or
blue/black tattoos) and plaques.
