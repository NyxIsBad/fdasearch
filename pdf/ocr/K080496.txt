3. Predicate Devices
The MOSAIC eCOQ2 is substantially equivalent to the predicate devices, including
the Lumenis, Inc. (Lumenis UltraPulse Encore Carbon Dioxide Surgical Laser
and Delivery Device Accessories) (K022060); the Sharplan Lasers, Inc. Model
1080 CO2 Surgical Laser System (K933918); the Lumenis, Inc. Modified
Lumenis Family of UltraPulse SurgiTouch CO2 Laser Systems (K030147), the

4. Device Description
The MOSAIC eCO2 Laser System consists of a self-contained console, an
articulated arm delivery system with scanner handpiece and a footswitch. The
MOSAIC eCO2 produces a beam of coherent infrared light (10.6um) and has two
operation modes (Static mode and Dynamic Mode). The laser works in medical
applications because 10.6um is near the peak of tissue water absorption. When the
water in the tissue absorbs the laser energy, it heats up. This heating causes
instantaneous vaporization of the target tissue.
The MOSAIC eCO2 Laser System utilizes a CO2 tube to generate a laser beam
with a wavelength of 10.6 um and uses a scanner handpiece. The physician can
optimize the effect for different applications by controlling the power of the laser
pulse and using a different scan pattern.

§. Indications for Use
The MOSAIC eCO2 is indicated for use in dermatological procedures requiring
ablation (removal), resurfacing and coagulation of soft tissue. Treatment of
wrinkles; rhytides, furrows, fine lines, textural irregularities, pigmented lesions
and vascular dyschromia.
6. Performance Data
None presented.

Dear Ms. O’Connell:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivaient (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance
at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address
