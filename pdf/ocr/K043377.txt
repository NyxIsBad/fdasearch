Dear Ms. Elkin:
This letter corrects our substantially equivalent letter of June 1,2005.
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices,
good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be
found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalencedeterminationdoes not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to continue marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalenceof your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market. xX
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,

Description of the Device
Zeno is a portable hand-held device that produces accurately controlled low level
sustained heat for use in treating dermatological disorders, specifically, mild to moderate
acne. Individual acne blemishes are treated for a preset time of 2 4 minutes at a preset
temperature. The treatment tip is made from a biocompatible material and delivers the
specific low-level heat to the individual acne blemish. The device is powered by
techargeable AAA nickel-metal hydride batteries.

510(k) Premarket Notification
Tyrell, Incorporated Zeno™ Acne Device
Indications for Use
Zeno is indicated for the treatment of individual acne pimples in persons with mild to
moderate inflammatory acne.
Performance Data
Preclinical and clinical testing performance testing was conducted with Zeno.
* Preclinical Testing
In vitro testing demonstrated significant sensitivity of p. acnes bacterial cells to
the effects of sustained low-level heat.
Biocompatibility testing of the tip material was conducted in accordance with the
ISO 10993 Biological Testing of Medical and Dental Materials and Devices and
the tip material is considered biocompatible.
Zeno was tested for EMI in accordance with the IEC 60601-1 standard. Zeno
operates within the EMI emission, susceptibility and static discharge levels
specified in the IEC 60601-1 standard.
Clinical Testing
Clinical testing was conducted in both a controlled practitioner office
environment and a consumer home-use environment and submitted as part of the
510(k) application to confirm that Zeno is as safe and effective as the predicate
device, The controlled clinical study design was a randomized, doubled-blinded
study.
Substantial Equivalence
The Zeno and its predicate devices are all devices that use either light or heat to treat the
dermatological condition of mild to moderate acne by exposing the surface of the skin to
the light at precise wavelengths and temperatures or heat at precise temperatures.
Although there are differences in the technological characteristics of the Zeno and its
predicate devices, those differences do not raise new questions of safety or efficacy.
Another difference is Zeno will be available over the counter (OTC) versus the predicate
device which is prescription use only however there are no new safety or efficacy
concerns regarding this use as evidenced by the clinical testing that was conducted on
Zeno, Thus, Zeno is substantially equivalent to the predicate device for treatment of
mild to moderate acne.
Conclusion:
Based on the indications for use, technological characteristics, performance testing and
comparison to predicate devices, the proposed device has been shown to be safe and
effective for its intended use.
