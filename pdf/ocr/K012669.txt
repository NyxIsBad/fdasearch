(541) 549-4164
Date summary prepared: August 10, 2001
Device name:
Proprietary name: Reprocessed Electrosurgical Electrodes
Common or usual name: Electrodes or probes
Classification name: Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation device and
accessories, 878.4400, or Arthroscope, 888.1100.
Legally marketed device for substantial equivalence comparison:
The predicate device for each reprocessed electrosurgical electrode is the same
product as provided by the original manufacturer.
Description of the device:
The devices that are the subject of this submission are used to remove tissue and
control bleeding during surgery. They are made of a variety of materials and come
in different shapes. They come from several different original equipment
manufacturers as single use devices. Reprocessing includes cleaning,
refurbishing, testing, packaging, and sterilization. It allows the electrodes to be
used several times rather than just once.
Intended use of device:
Reprocessed electrosurgical electrodes are intended to remove tissue and control
bleeding during surgery by use of electrical current.
Technological characteristics:
The device features of the reprocessed electrosurgical electrodes and the single
use electrodes are very similar. The materials, dimensions, and geometry of
individual electrodes are identical. Both sets of products are provided sterile. The
technical characteristics, method of use, and compatibility with other surgical
instruments are also identical. The only difference is that the original products are
sold for single use, while the reprocessed products can be used several times.
Testing conducted:
Each electrosurgical electrode is tested for functionality as part of the
reprocessing procedures. Validation of the sterility protocol was also included in
the submission.
Performance testing:
Comparative performance testing and clinical evaluations were not included as
part of this $10(k).
