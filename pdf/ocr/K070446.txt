2. Name of Device
Trade or Proprietary Name: Cool-tip™ Switching Controller
Common/Classification Name: Electrosurgical Cutting and Coagulation Device
and Accessories
3. Predicate Devices
The intended use of the Cool-tip™ Switching Controller is identical to that of the Cooltip™ RF System. The Cool-tip™ RF System received initial FDA clearance in 510(k)s
K973297 (10/29/97) and K984552 (3/5/99). Additional clearance with the Cool-tip™ RF
System was obtained for specific claims under 510(k)s K042216 (Liver lesions,
11/12/04), KO52796 (Osteoid Osteoma claim, 2/3/06) and KO53290 (Liver tumor claim,
3/15/06).
4, Device Description
The Cool-tip™ Switching Controller (CTSW Control) is an adjunct device for the Cooltip™ RF Ablation Generator. Power from the generator is routed to the controller and
allows the physician to ablate lesions with one single Cool-tip electrode or one cluster
electrode, or simultaneously with two or three single pre-placed electrodes. The
controller sequentially switches power between the electrodes. Power is applied to the
first electrode until the tissue impedance rises to the target value (30 percent above the
baseline value), or until 30 seconds have elapsed. Then power is switched to the next
electrode. Power is switched repeatedly until the selected procedure time is reached.
The controller does not alter the basic functions available on the generator. The
controller has the same timing, temperature measurement, and impedance
measurement functions available on the generator. The controller does not change the
power available at the electrodes compared to the generator without the controller. The
indications for use and the control mechanisms for the Switching Controller remain the
same as for the generator.

The Switching Controller is an accessory that allows for the simultaneous Activation of
multiple electrodes. Activation of muitiple electrodes during a single treatment session
is a convenience for the physician and allows for the ablation of multiple lesions
simultaneously, or for the ablation of one large tumor when the electrodes are placed 2
cm apart. Placing three single electrodes in close proximity produces a cluster
electrode where the physician is controlling the cluster spacing. The controller
automates the manual function of cauterization of the electrode track by controlling the
temperature during electrode removal.
The front panel of the Switching Controller contains an on/off power switch, activation
switches for ablation and cauterization, ablation timer displaysand buttons, three (3)
electrode ports for the connection of selected electrodes, three (3) buttons for activating
selected electrode channels, three (3) temperature probe displays with adjacent green
bars to indicate the activated electrode channel, and three (3) current/watts displays for
each electrode channel.
The Cool-tip™ Switching Controller is comprised of the following components:
* Switching controller
¢ Cable, which delivers power from the generator to the controller

The Switching Controller is connected to the Cool-tip RF generator by a dedicated cable
that delivers power from the generator to the switching controller. The Switching
Controller cannot direct power to the electrodes without the generator.

5. Intended Use
The intended use of the Cool-tip™ Switching Controller is identical to that of the Cooltip™ RF System, as follows:
“The Cool-tip™ Switching Controller is to be used with the Cool-tip™ RF System and is
intended for use in percutaneous, laparoscopic, intraoperative coagulation and ablation
of tissue, such as the partial or complete ablation of non-resectable liver tumors, and
osteoid osteoma tumors within bone.”

6. Summary of Technological Characteristics
The Cool-tip™ Switching Controller (CTSW Control) is an adjunct device for the Cooltip™ RF Ablation Generator. The Switching Controller is an accessory that allows for
the simultaneous activation of multiple pre-placed electrodes. The Cool-tip™ Switching
Controller has the same basic technological characteristics as the predicate device
noted above.

7. Performance and Clinical Data
Radiofrequency ablation with the Cool-tip™ Switching Controller has proven to be safe
and efficacious for the ablation of tissue. Preclinical testing on bovine liver (ex vivo and
in vivo) verified that the lesions produced using the Cooi-tip™ Switching Controller and
Cool-tip™ Generator, along with various electrode configurations, are comparable to
those lesions produced by the Cool-tip Generator only and with the same electrode
configurations.

Trade/Device Name: Cool-tip™ Switching Controller

Regulation Number: 21 CFR 878.4400

Regulation Name: Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation device and accessories

Regulatory Class: II

Product Code: GEI

Dated: February 14, 2007

Received: February 15, 2007
Dear Ms. Ross:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic ,
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 ~ Ms. Julie Ross
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 51 O(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
“Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
