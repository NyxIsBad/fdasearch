with Superficial Vein Reflux.

Technological Characteristics

The 100W Ceralas D 980 is identical to the previously cleared 50W Ceralas D 980
except for four modifications. The 100W Ceralas D 980 has a maximum wattage of
100W, while the cleared 50W Ceralas D890 has a maximum wattage of 50W. In
addition, the 100W Ceralas D980 has a beam divergence of 12.79, rather than 20.59,
and therefore can be used with delivery fibers of smaller diameter (0.22 NA or
greater) than those recommended for use with the 50W Ceralas D 980 (0.37 NA or
greater). Finally, the 100W Ceralas D 980 contains additional diodes.
Performance Data

The device complies with the following voluntary consensus standards: 21 C.F.R.
§§ 1040.10 & 1040.11; ANSI/AAMI ES1; IEC 601-1; IEC 601-2-22; EN 60825-1, and
ANSI/AAMI/ISO 10993-7.

Substantial Equivalence

The 100W Ceralas D 980 has the same intended use and the same general and
specific indications for use as the cleared 50W Ceralas D 980 Laser System. It also
has the same intended use and some of the same general indications for use as the
cleared 100W Ceralas Nd:YAG Laser System. The four minor technological
modifications to the cleared 50W Ceralas D980 incorporated into the 100W Ceralas
D 980 -- the increase in maximum wattage from 50W to 100W and in the number of
diodes used to generate that wattage and the difference in beam divergence and
recommended use with a smaller diameter delivery fiber -- do not raise any new
questions of safety or effectiveness. Thus, the 100W Ceralas D 980 is substantially
equivalent to its predicate devices. :

Dear Mr. Kahan:
This letter corrects our substantially equivalent letter of August 10, 2005.
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices,
good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class IIT (PMA),
it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be
found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Page 2 - Mr. Jonathan S. Kahan
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all.the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to continue marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your
device to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0120. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
