SIE LTD. SURGICAL INSTRUMENT ENGINEERING
Allmendstr. 11
Port/Biel, SWITZERLAND 2562
Registration Number: Pending Registration
Regulatory Class: Class II
Classification Name: Ophthalmic Laser
Regulation Number: 21 CFR 878.4810, 886.4370
Regulation Name: Laser surgical instrument for use in general and plastic surgery and
in dermatology
Product Code: GEX, HNO
Reviewing Panel: Ophthalmic Devices
Indications for Use: The Da Vinci™ Femtosecond Surgical Laser is an ophthalmic
surgical laser indicated for use in the creation of a corneal flap in patients undergoing
LASIK surgery or other treatment requiring initial lamellar resection of the cornea.
Performance Standards: The Da Vinci™ Femtosecond Surgical Laser is in full
compliance with FDA’s Performance Standard for Light-emitting Products; 21 CFR
§1040.10 and 1040.11.
Device Description: The Da Vinci™ Femtosecond Surgical Laser is a precision
ophthalmic surgical laser designed for use in performing lamellar corneal resections. The
cutting action of the Da Vinci™ Femtosecond Surgical Laser is achieved through
nonlinear absorption of infrared laser light and subsequent disintegration of tissue,
created by focused ultrashort pulses which are delivered through a lens while fixating the
eye under a vacuum.
The complete Da Vinci™ Femtosecond Surgical Laser system consists of the following
functional units:
1. Base Station (BS), integrating the Laser Unit, Fast Scan Unit (FS), and Fixed
Mirror Articulating Arm (FMAA)
2. Handpiece (HP), integrating the Slow Scan Unit (SS) and the Cutting Lens
3. Accessories, comprising Suction Ring, Distance Foil, Vacuum Tube with
Strainer and Handpiece Cover

The Da Vinci™ Femtosecond Surgical Laser is movable on four rollers. Two rollers can
be locked by a mechanical brake. For movement inside the clinic, HP and FMAA can be
locked in a secured transport position.
Base Station
The Base Station is in a position perpendicular to the patient's body axis, allowing
manipulation of the FMAA from both sides of the BS. The Base Station is height
adjustable in a way as to allow positioning of the shoulder (middle) joint at 950-1250mm
above ground. This allows the adjustment of the system to different types of patient
couches and Excimer lasers within a range of 300mm. The nominal reference height is
1000mm.
On the table of the Base Station there is park position where HP and forearm of the
FMAA are locked when the system is not in operation. In this park position the
accessories, i.e. the distances foil DF, the suction ring SR and the vacuum tubing can be
mounted comfortably.
The Da Vinci™ Femtosecond Surgical Laser has a protective housing that prevents
unintentional access to laser radiation.
Fixed mirror articulating arm
The FMAA consists of two arm elements (upper and lower arm) and three joints
(shoulder, elbow and hand) connecting the HP to the BS. Thus, the HP can easily be
moved by the user in all 6 degrees of freedom of the space.
The FMAA is balanced in a way as to hold the residual net force, i.e., without external
force on HP or of FMAA on eye, at < +2N. Thus the stress upon the eye is minimized.
In the working position all links of the Fixed Mirror Articulating Arm are aligned roughly in
a right angle (i.e. at 90° +30°). During resection the elbow of the Fixed Mirror Articulating
Arm is positioned roughly above the torso of the patient. These positions allow optimal
manual control of the FMAA with the HP.
To prevent uncontrolled rotation around the shoulder joint, the upper arm of the FMAA
can be inserted in a special clamp mounted below the touch screen, from where it can
be removed manually by the user requiring a force of <5N. The limitation of the tractive
, force allows the operator to remove the FMAA from the clamp by holding the HP. During
transportation inside the clinic, the clamp protects the FMAA from excessive strain and
vibration. The clamp further provides vertical support of about 5ON to the FMAA. For
transports outside the clinic, the FMAA is to be unmounted.
Electronic Control System
Several features ensure permanent control of the Da Vinci™ Femtosecond Surgical
Laser and an immediate shut-down in case of malfunction of a system component:
Master ON Switch. The Base Station is turned on by a Master ON Switch. This switch
can remain ON even if the system is not used for a long time.

Softstart: The system is started by pressing the softstart button on stand of the touch
screen. As soon as the internal power supplies are powered, a green LED indicator on
the stand of the touch screen indicates “power ON’.
Shutdown: The system is switched OFF by software control. After the shutdown
procedure all major parts are powerless.
Watchdog System. The entire electronic system is permanently checked by an
independent hardware system. If any critical software task does not response in less
than 1 second, the system automatically shuts down the critical components (laser
module, shutter, fast scan, height adjustment).
Laser Enabling. When the softstart button is pressed, after a short start-up sequence the
Da Vinci™ Femtosecond Surgical Laser System Window appears on the touch screen
and requests a login name and password. Laser emission is disabied until the user
selects appropriate treatment parameters and all internal contro! parameters are
checked.
Laser Ready Indicator: As soon as the internal laser module generates laser light, a
yellow LED indicator on the stand of the touch screen lights.
Laser Emission Indicator. Laser emission is indicated by a red LED indicator located on
the stand of the touch screen.
Safety Shutter. The laser module is always completely shut down, except 1 minute prior
to and during resection. A safety shutter controls the laser emission during operation.
The shutter is monitored by two sensors indicating correct operation.
Emergency OFF Button. The Emergency OFF Button is a red button located on top of
the table of the base station and reachable from all operating positions. When pressed,
the button directly, ie. without any use of software, shuts off all critical components, i.e.
mainly the laser module. This control should be used only in the event of an emergency.
Software. The software of the Da Vinci™ Femtosecond Surgical Laser is configured in
such a way as to prevent errors and maladjustments to a large extent. Access via
graphical user interface is restricted to the program level, i.e., the operators cannot see
the operating system level of the controls. Similarly, critical parameters are only
accessible to special service users (password protected).
The text on the graphical user interface is available in English. The main steps of the
procedure are confirmed by voice confirmation.
Laser: The internal laser module is a Class 4 laser product, the laser output radiation is
Class 3B.
Handpiece
The working position of the Handpiece is tocated in the focus of the operating
microscope of the Excimer Laser. A dedicated viewing window on the top of the HP
allows the operator an almost undisturbed view of the eye through the operating
microscope and the HP. Thus the HP with the laser exit windows the suction ring
Page 3 of 5

mounted below can easily be positioned on the patient's eye. LED illumination in the HP
provides sufficient light to view the surgical region.
The glass of the viewing window is specially coated in order to block the laser light and
thus to protect the observing operator against the minimum stray light.
During laser resection the handpiece is in a horizontal position and approximately
perpendicular to the patient's body axis. Disturbing contours within the environment of
the eye are thus largely avoided.
Accessories
Suction Ring
The reusable Suction Ring (SR) connects the HP to the eye during resection. The
Suction Ring is held to the eye by the force of a vacuum. The vacuum tubing connects
the Suction Ring to the vacuum supply inside the Base Station.
Design, materials, cleaning and sterilization procedures of the Suction Ring are identical
to the SR used with the Amadeus Microkeratome cleared under K993190.
Distance Foil
The foil is an adhesive film made of medical grade plastic..
Vacuum Tube with Strainer
The sterile vacuum tube consists of a strainer, the tube, and a connector to the Base
Station.
Handpiece Covers
The two Handpiece Covers (front and rear) ensure the sterility of the handgrip on the
HP. They are slid over the HP body and mechanically interlocked, aré reusable and
autoclavable.
Footswitch
The casting footswitch is an UL 2601.1, DIN EN and CAN/CAS conforming off-the-shelf
product.
The footswitch cannot be activated unless all steps in preparation for resection are
completed.
Test Body
The disposable Test Body is used for the daily functional control of the Da Vinci™
Femtosecond Surgical Laser and is destroyed by the test.
Method of Resection
Prior to resection the eye is flattened by the laser exit window and fixed by vacuum to
maintain a precise distance from cutting lens to focal point. The maximum depth of the
| focal point is at 250 um +5 um minus the thickness of the distance foil (e.g.,.110 um),
thus preventing cuts into the endothel. The fixation of the eye is achieved by a vacuum
which is generated applied to a suction ring. The resulting applanated surface and thus
the flap diameter are determined by the geometry of the suction ring.

The corneal flap is created by the software controlled xy-scanner (Slow Scan) which
moves the cutting lens inside the HP over the flattened surface following a meander-like
scanning pattern (Slow Scan trajectory). Simultaneously to this Slow Scan motion, the
laser beam oscillates perpendicular to this trajectory (Fast Scan trajectory). The Fast
Scan frequency is adjustable. The surgical effect is achieved through nonlinear
absorption of infrared laser light and subsequent disintegration of molecular bonds.
Substantial Equivalence
The technical characteristics of the Da Vinci™ Femtosecond Surgical Laser are
substantially equivalent to those of the Pulsion FS Laser of IntraLase Corp. cleared
under K013941. The intended use and the indication for use are identical to those of the
Amadeus Microkeratome cleared under K993190.
