Device Name:
Trade Name: DenLaser 800 Plus
Common Name: 810nm Diode Laser
Product Classification: Laser Instrument, Surgical
Legally Marketed Predicate Devices for Substantial Equivalence:
7 sss ss-+- = Odyssey 2.4G Diode Laser - a ene me
DenLaser 800, Manufactured by CAO Group, Inc.
Cynosure Accolade Laser
Rationale for Substantial Equivalence:

The aforementioned laser devices and their accompanying delivery systems share
similar indications for use in the oral environment, similar design features including
wavelength, operating controls, and laser delivery method. The devices share similar
methods of control systems, safety features, and performance monitoring. The devices
share similar performance specifications including power output and energy type. The
devices share similar applications to soft tissue.

Description of Submitted Device:
~The DenLaser 800 Plus is a device for delivering laser energy to surfaces within
the oral cavity. This energy is generated by solid-state diodes, which provide a consistent
and reliable generation of laser energy at 810 + 20om for a maximum of 5 watts of
energy output. The laser energy is delivered to surgical site by means of a proprietary
optical fiber system, which allow for the safe transmission of laser energy to the sire
without creating undue risk to the patient or operatory staff by errant or collateral laser .
emissions. The device features some user definable settings, including a switchable

630nm aiming beam, adjustable power output for both the working beam and aiming
beam, and continuous delivery or pulse delivery option.

The working end of the delivery fiber is contained within metal handpiece with a
disposable single-use tip. This handpiece system is provided with the device. The

Intended Uses of the DenLaser 800 Plus diode laser system:

The device is intended to be used for a variety of surgical procedures on soft
tissue within the oral cavity. See Indications for Use on page 2-1.

Technological Characteristics and Substantial Equivalence:

The Odyssey 2.4G Diode Laser uses solid state diodes to generate laser energy in
the 810nm range. This system uses a fiber delivery system to transmit laser energy to the
surgical site. The system also features a 630nm aiming beam and features controls that
allow for adjusting the output of the working beam, and switching between a continuous
or pulsed-mode laser emission. The device features a wireless foot switch for actuating

2... the working beam. The maximum output of the working beam is 5 watts, 0

The DenLaser 800 uses solid state diodes to generate laser energy in the 810nm
range. This system uses a fiber delivery system to transmit laser energy to the surgical
site. The system also features a 630nm aiming beam and features controls that allow for
adjusting the output of the working beam, and switching between a continuous or pulsedmode Jaser emission. The maximum output of the unit 5 watts.

The Cynosure Accolade Laser uses an excited Alexandrite crystal to generate a
laser wavelength of 755nm. The system uses and optical fiber to deliver laser energy to
the surgical site. The system also features a 635nm aiming beam. The system is used to
apply laser energy to cutaneous and subcutaneous pigmentations, whether naturally
occurring or artificially applied. The discolorations absorb the laser energy causing the
discoloration to become altered such that the color is removed. The maximum output of
the unit is 1.8] at a pulse width of 60 nanoseconds.

The DenLaser 800 Plus diode laser complies with the performance requirements
of 21 CFR 1040.10 and 1040.11, with permissible deviations relative to Laser Notice 50,
dated July 26, 2001. The device also complies with IEC 60601-1:1998+A1, IEC 606012-22:1995, TEC 60825-1:1993+A1+A2, 47 CFR 15 and 18, and ETSI 301-489-1.

Dear Mr. Larsen:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device °
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class I] (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801): good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
