b. Date Summary Prepared

c. Description of Device
The Estech Cobra Bipolar System is identical to the Boston Scientific Cobra Bipolar
System.
Both Bipolar Systems are comprised of two components: a reusable surgical clamp an
associated coagulating device known as the Cobra Bipolar Insert. The Bipolar Insert is a
sterile, single use device that transmits radiofrequency (RF) energy to coagulate soft
tissues and fits in a jaw of the clamp. The Bipolar System will be used with the Boston
Scientific Cobra Electrosurgical Unit (ESU). The ESU delivers 460 kHz of RF energy to
selected Bipolar Insert electrodes, modulates the RF energy to keep all selected Bipolar
Insert electrodes’ temperatures essentially the same, and adjusts the power output to
maintain the maximum temperature of all selected electrodes close to the set point.

d. Intended Use
The ESTECH Cobra Bipolar System is intended for the coagulation of
soft tissue during general surgery. The System may also be used to
coagulate blood and soft tissue to produce heniostasis.

The Estech Cobra Bipolar System is identical in intended use, technology, design,
materials, manufacture, packaging and sterilization to the predicate Boston Scientific
Cobra Bipolar System.

Scientifics’ product line over to Estech. For the time being Boston Scientific will
continue to manufacture the device. Estech will add additional contract manufacturers as
needed.
Estech concludes that the Estech Cobra Bipolar System is substantially equivalent to the
Boston Scientific Cobra Bipolar System.
f. Summary of Supporting Data
Supporting data is not necessary to support this submission since the Estech Cobra
Bipolar System is identical to the predicate device, the Boston Scientific Cobra Bipolar
System (K023288).

Dear Mr. Coombs:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device

You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA),
it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device
can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA

that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
