4, Product Description
The Sphinx system is a surgical aser system operating at a wavelength of 2.1
micron. The purpose of the laser is the ablation, coagulation, dissection and
resection of soft tissue. The laser is designed for open surgery and surgical
applications in aqueous media. The laser power is delivered via standard silica
laser fibers. The distal tip is guided by a handpiece or endoscopic surgical
instrument.

6. Rationale for Substantial Equivatence
The Sphinx laser system with fiber optic delivery devices share the same intended use,
indications for use, similar design features and functional features and therefore are
substantially equivalent to the Lumenis VersaPulse PowerSuite 100 watt Hotmium Laser,
and the Trimedyne OmniMax 80 watt Holmium Laser.
7. Conclusion
The Sphinx Laser System with fiber optic delivery devices were found to be substantially
equivalent to similar currently marketed and predicate surgical laser systems and
delivery devices,

Dear Mr. Allen:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the des ice
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments. or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug.
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class HI (PMA). it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited 10: registration and listing (21
CFR Part $07); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as sel
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820). and if applicable, the clectronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2—Mr. Peter Allen
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial cquivalence of your device to a legally
markcted predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
