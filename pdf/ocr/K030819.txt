4 Device Description
The PlasmaJet™ system consists of a range of single-use open or laparoscopic
handpieces that are used for coagulation using neutral argon plasma. A console is
used to power the handpiece and a footswitch and a service module (providing a
convenient base and housing for an argon tank) completes the system.
In the PlasmaJet™ system, as in a bipolar electrosurgery system, both anode and
cathode used to generate the argon plasma are contained within the handpiece, and
no ground plate is used. Because both electrodes are located within the enclosure of
the handpiece there is no current flow through the patient and no risk of alternate
site burns. In the PlasmaJet™ handpiece, a specially designed series of electrodes
allows a relatively low voltage (of about 30V) to generate a more energetic and
extensive argon plasma than that used in an argon beam coagulator. The
PlasmaJet™ plasma uses a much lower flow of argon gas than is used in the argon
beam coagulator; the plasma is electrically neutral and comprises a mixture of excited
atgon atoms, argon ions, and electrons that emerge from the tip of the handpiece in
an intense pale blue jet or beam.
When the plasma jet reaches the bleeding tissue, it gives up its kinctic energy as heat
and causes coagulation of the bleeding surface by a series of processes. First, the
physical force of the flowing stream of argon plasma removes liquid blood from the
tissue surface or vessel. Secondly, the energy dissipated from the plasma to the tissue
desiccates the tissue to form a series of layers of eschar that seal the tissue surface
and prevent further bleeding.

5 Intended Use
The PlasmaJet™ system is a neutral plasma coagulator that is designed for
coagulation in open surgery and laparoscopic surgery.

6 Summary of Substantial Equivalence
The PlasmaJet™ system is similar in design, intended use and performance
characteristics to the predicate devices. It differs in combining the electrodes used to
generate argon plasma within the handpiece, and does not require the use of an
electrosurgical grounding plate, nor does a current pass through the patient as in
conventional electrosurgery or argon beam coagulation. Animal and clinical studies
have been performed and these have established that the neutral plasma coagulator
provides more effective coagulation than the predicate devices.

Dear Professor Gibson:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket appro val application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class JI (Special Controls) or class {ll (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801), good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
“Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
