Device Description
The Conmed Beamer System CE600 with Accessories is an electrosurgical system that
uses high frequency (HF) electrical current waveforms to cut and/or coagulate tissue
whereby coagulation can be assisted by Argon gas.The system comprises of the following
components:
Electrosurgical unit (ESU) Beamer Mate CE200
The Beamer Mate CE200 is an electrosurgery generator for monopolar and bipolar
application. It features two monopolar and two bipolar outputs that can be set to output
power, current mode and activation source independently. For each output, these settings
: can be provided for cutting mode and coagulation mode in separate arrays, called
channels, on a color TFT display. This TFT display provides the user with actual settings
and operational information of all four outputs and enables operation of the device by
navigation in menus on the display using channel selection buttons, a MENU button and a
rotary switch with axial pushbutton function. The device is intended as a program-based
HF device.The manufacturer delivers the unit with exemplary programs for a whole range

of different applications. However, the surgeon is free to modify these programs and store
them under a new name in accordance with his/her own preferences and individual
requirements. The unit has various cutting and coagulation current forms with defined |
grades or flexible wattage ranges to provide flexibility in interventional applications. Further :
features are monitoring of the return electrode, activation of HF output power by finger
switches or by footswitch and service functions, accessible by Setup menu. Also, the unit i
can be used in association with an Argon Unit, the Beamer Plus CB200. The ESU is !
supplied nonsterile and is reusable. :
Argon gas supply unit Beamer Plus CB200
The Beamer Plus CB200 enables and controls the gas flow required for the surgical
process of argon beam coagulation. Terminals include argon gas inlet from the gas '
cylinder’s pressure reducer, gas outlet for connection to the argon probe and a socket for :
connection with the Beamer Mate CE200 by means of CE/CB interface cable CB200-A03.
Power supply and control is performed by the ESU, setting of flow rates and other beamer
parameters as well as gas flow activation is done by the ESU. The only operation element
at the CB200 is a “Purge” key that starts a three second’s gas flow for filling a freshly |
connected probe with argon gas. The housings of CE200 and CB200 are matched for |
stacking both units with the CE200 upside. The housings are equipped with means to
prevent horizontal movement of the units which enables placing on inclined surfaces
without the hazard of slipping off or being torn off by connected cables or accessories. The
CB200 is supplied nonsterile and is reusable.
Pressure reducer
The pressure reducer (CB200-A02) is an essential accessory delivered with the CB200
Beamer Unit. It drops the gas pressure of the argon gas cylinder which may be as high as
200 bar to a pre-regulated pressure in the range of about 4 bar which is input to the Argon
- . .Unit.-The pressure reducer is equipped with a CGA580 connector at the high pressure
side and a fast-lock connector at the beamer’s side.
|
Cart CC200
The cart is intended as the system’s carrier with a top plate to pick up the stacked ESU
and Beamer Unit as well as the ESU alone. Inside the cart’s body, an argon gas cylinder
with pressure reducer can be placed and fixed. The cart is equipped with four swivel
castors on stems protruding from the lower corners which provide mobility combined with
high tilt stability. Two of four castors feature foot-tip operable brake levers to prevent
random movement of the cart. A non-detachable (detachable just by the help of a tool)
mains cord feeds the mains power through the cart to two cables with mains plug which
allow mains supply of two units assembled at the cart, i.e. the ESU and a further unit that
requires mains power. Further properties are three terminals for common ground
connection, a basket for picking up accessories, a standard rail for infusion holders or else,
a pickup for the foot switch and a handle for moving the cart.
Footswitches
A double footswitch (CE200-A01) is an essential accessory delivered with the ESU. It
enables activation of cutting mode HF output power by pressing the yellow pedal or
activation of coagulation mode HF output power by pressing the blue pedal. Allocation of
the footswitch to one of the HF outputs is done in the main menu of the output channels.
A single footswitch (CE200-A02) is optional delivered with the ESU.

The ConMed Beamer System CE600 with Accessories is intended to deliver !
electrosurgical current and Argon gas for the cutting, coagulation and argon beam assisted
coagulation on tissue when used in conjunction with compatible applicators or probes. !
Similarities and Differences of the Device to the Predicate Device ;
Electrosurgical unit (ESU) Beamer Mate CE200: i

. why
Similarities to Predicate Device
Both devices are intended for the same use. The handling of both devices is based on
programs, both units use a color TFT display to show actual settings of the output |
channels and to manage the “background” settings in menus. Both units feature channel i
selection buttons to select a channel for being set. Both units use finger switches or foot
switches for HF power activation. In both systems, the foot switch pedals can be allocated
to any output. Both devices feature monopolar cutting currents with low, medium and |
higher hemostasis during cutting and feature special current modes for gastrointestinal
procedures where cutting phases altemate with coagulation phases. Both devices feature
monopolar coagulation current modes for soft coagulation, for preparation and for noncontact coagulation with high voltage what is a prerequisite to generate a consistent argon
beam. The output characteristics (Power, Impedance Matching, Voltages and
Frequencies) are equivalent and same effective. Both devices feature bipolar cutting and
coagulation currents. Return electrode monitoring of single-plate and dual-plate electrodes
is possible with both units.
Differences to Predicate Device
The CE200 features two fixed combo sockets M1 and M2 for monopolar current which
accept the three-pin connector which is most common in the US market as well as the

: “Bovie-Plug’, and two fixed sockets for bipolar current for connection of two-pin connectors

with 28mm separation. The upper bipolar socket B1 is a combo socket which accepts.a
coaxial 12mm plug also. The lower bipolar socket B2 accepts the two-pin connector and

features two additional 2mm sockets for bipolar finger switch activation and bipolar '
instrument recognition. The Predicate Device uses three modular sockets in
interchangeable drawers which may be monopolar, bipolar or both as well. Channel .
selection at the CE200 is done by pressing the yellow key of an output to set or change ;
the cutting properties of this output or by pressing the blue key of this output to set or
change its coagulation properties. During this procedure, the settings of all other channels
are displayed simultaneously which gives an overall overview of the system's setting.
Display of settings of a channel! which is not used may be blanked by pressing the channel
selection button and keeping it pressed for two seconds. With the Predicate Device, output
selection is done by pressing the selection button at the output. The screen then displays
the properties of this selected channel only, selection of a certain property is done by
touch pads which are embedded in the frame of the display unit. With the CE200, :
changing of values and log-in is done by means of a rotary switch with axial push function
while the Predicate Device uses three pushbuttons for the same purpose. i
Argon gas supply unit Beamer Plus CB200:
Similarities to Predicate Device |
Both devices generate a controlled argon gas flow which occurs on activation of an argon :
coagulation current at the ESU. Both beamer systems are designed to operate with their |
dedicated ESU only since power supply, flow activation and flow control is done by the
ESU. Argon beamer system state is displayed on the ESU in both systems. Both systems :
feature a “Purge” key to remove residual air out of an argon probe and flush the probe with :
argon gas.
Differences to Predicate Device
ESU CE200 and Argon Unit CB200 are connected by means of a connection cable that |
supplies auxiliary power and control signals from the ESU to the Argon System. HF-power
bere _-is net-fed through the Argon Unit. With the Predicate Device,.the.connection between both :
system components is done by case-to case connectors which are incorporated into the
bottom of the ESU and the top of the argon unit. This connection serves also as a HF
power feedthrough from the ESU to the argon unit. With the system CE200 and CB200,
the connection of the argon probe is done at one of the monopolar outputs M1 or M2 of the
CE200 using the standard three-pin connector, and at the male luer-lock gas outlet of the
CB200. With the predicate Device, electric and gas connection is done at the argon unit
using a special multifunctional plug and a female luer-lock gas outlet.
Pressure reducer:
Similarities to Predicate Device
The pressure reducer CB200-A02 is the same model (same technology, same materials,
same characteristics) from the same manufacturer (Linde company) as the Predicate
Device.
Cart CC200:
Similarities to Predicate Device
Functionality of both carts is the same.
Differences to Predicate Device
The cart GC200 has a mains cord which is detachable only by use of a tool. The Predicate
Device has a detachable mains cord and outlet sockets for mains power instead of cables
so that additional connection cables are required unless the mains cord is connected to
the ESU directly.

Connecting Cable for flexible argon probes “a :
Similarities to Predicate Device :
Both — the new and the predicate Connecting Cables have the same intended use,
principles of operation and technological characteristics. They are non-sterile and : |
reusable. The connector receptable for the flexible argon probes is compatible to the
Conmed CET Argon Probes. The products have no patient contact.
The conecting cable has the same dimensions in length and diameter. :
Differences to Predicate Device
The Gas Connector of both devices is Luer-Lock, whereas the Predicate is a male
connector and the New Device has a female connector. Within the New Device the HFPlug is a Standard 3 pin-plug, whereas the Predicate has a special designed plug. The
minor differences do not affect the safety or effectiveness of the product. |
Conclusion |
The Conmed Beamer System with its component CE200 shows same performance of the |
current modes in comparison with the Predicate Device and thus represents good i
substantial equivalence to the Predicate Device. |
The fact that the HF power is not fed through the CB200 Argon Unit as it is the case with
the Predicate Device does not affect the clinical properties at all. Since all other technical |
details are the same, the CB200 with accessories represents also substantial equivalence '
to its predicate Device. :

The CC200 cart shows same properties as its Predicate Device. Minor differences do not
affect the clinical properties of the system.
Thus, the system CE600 with accessories raises no new issues of safety or effectiveness. |
