For the E2 MicroProbe
4, - Predicate Devices
The legally marketed device to which equivalence is being claimed is:
Uram Ophthalmic Laser Endoscope — MicroProbe
5.- Device Description
The Endo Optiks E2 MicroProbe™ is the principal component in a new portable
laser and endoscopy system. The complete system consists of the therapeutic
laser, the endoscope, the monitor and the footswitch. This compact unit
creates the opportunity to simultaneously image and photocoagulate the ciliary
processes through a corneal incision. It is especially indicated for the safe and
effective treatment of glaucoma in combination with cataract surgery.
Important vitreo-retinal applications can be realized. It can be used for the
contact and non-contact excision, hemostatis, incision and vaporization of soft
tissue. The E2 MicroProbe is a modification to the packaging of the original
MicroProbe.
Labeling: The MicroProbe will be renamed (relabeled) the E2 MicroProbe.
(Please see labels on Pages 2 & 3 of Attachment 1).

510(k) Summary
For the E2 MicroProbe
Indications For Use:
Ocular Endoscopy
Cylophophotocoagulation for glaucoma
Photocoagulation of the Retina
6.- Intended Use
The E2 MicroProbe’s intended use is for video imaging,
illumination and photocoagulation using up to 1.2 watt of
continuous wave radiation for endoscopic procedures. This is the
same intended use as the previously cleared ophthalmic
laser endoscope, K910532.
7.- Comparison of Technological Characteristics
This modification replaces the original MicroProbe with the E2
MicroProbe. The E2 MicroProbe has a different model of laser diode and
has been repackaged without the video monitor in a smaller,
streamlined cabinet. It has also been tested and found to be in
conformity with recognized standards.
8.- Nonclinical Tests Used in Determination of Substantial
Equivalence
The design of the E2 MicroProbe has been thoroughly validated at the
unit and system level. The tests showed that all system specifications
are satisfied.
9.- Conclusions From Nonclinical Testing
The testing of the modified device demonstrates that the performance is
substantially equivalent to the predicate device.

Re: K042918
Trade/Device Name: E2 Microprobe Laser and Endoscopy System
Regulation Number: 21 CFR 878.4810
Regulation Name: Laser surgical instrument for use in general and plastic surgery and in
dermatology
Regulatory Class: II
Product Code: GEX
Dated: October 18, 2004
Received: October 27, 2004
Dear Mr. Hertz:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
: CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act), 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 — Mr. Hertz
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or

Indications for Use
510(k) Number : K042918
Device Name: E2 MicroProbe laser and endoscopy system.
Indications for Use:
The ophthalmic laser endoscope is indicated for intraoperative photocoagulation
of the ciliary processes in the treatment of glaucoma, proliferative retinopathies,
retinal detachment, and for evaluation of the internal ocular structures in
patients with dense opacifications of the anterior segment which do allow a
posterior view.
Glaucoma
This instrument is indicated for the treatment of glaucoma in patients who have
failed with conventional topical and systemic medications, or previous laser
photocoagulation, or trabeculectomy and other filtering procedures, or
cyclocryotherapy or other cyclodestructive procedures.
The endophotocoagulation of ciliary processes under direct endoscopic view is
highly controllable, i.e. titratable, and has been demonstrated to be effective in
the treatment of glaucoma.
Vitreoretinal Surgery
The endoscopically controlled endophotocoagulation that is possible with.the
ophthalmic laser endoscope is also useful for endophotocoagulation:
e During vitreous surgery to produce chorioretinal scar around retinal breaks
or retinotomy sites
* To perform intraoperative panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) in
proliferative retinopathies
e To perform intraoperative retinal photocoagulation on a scleral buckle
to perform intraoperative photocoagulation around focal neovascularization
