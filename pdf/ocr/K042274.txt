D. DEVICE DESCRIPTION
1. Summary
1) PSD-60 technology
The PSD-60 is an Electrosurgery unit and is used in conjunction with a OLYMPUS ENDOPLASMA. or can be used alone. The PSD-60 has a 7-segment LCD (Liquid Crystal Display)
that provides the user with an on-screen setting and operational information.
The unit has various cutting and coagulation modes with defined effect levels to provide the
physician flexibility in applications (i.e. Its ability is to generate the HF current.).
The system has automatic start and stop features. When activated, the device has an alarm
as well as a visual error system (i.e. malfunctions or user errors are detected with medical
personnel being alerted visually and/or by sound with, in some cases, no energy being
delivered.).
Upon activation, energy delivered from the PSD-60 to the tissue is displayed in watts on the
7-segment display. Also, the unit can be used in association with an OLYMPUS compatible
ENDOPLASMA Argon plasma coagulator. The unit is non-sterile and is reusable.
2)ENDOPLASMA technology
The OLYMPUS ENDOPLASMA Is an Argon plasma coagulation system and is used in
conjunction with an OLYMPUS PSD-60.
The PSD-60 provides high frequency (HF) voltage to electrically charge Argon gas from the
ENDOPLASMA to form plasma In the gas stream when in close proximity to tissue.
Current density concentrates at the tissue surface from ENDOPLASMA (probe) causes
coagulation. The ENDOPLASMA with the PSD-60 has a 7-segment LCD (Liquid Crystal
Display) that provides the user with an on-screen setting operational information.
Software in the PSD-60 controls the microprocessor chip in an ENDOPLASMA. The PSD60/ENDOPLASMA are programmable and have error monitoring features. There is a
communications bus cable for the PSD-60 to communicate with an ENDOPLASMA.
A pressure reducer with sensor is provided to regulate the Argon gas going into the
ENDOPLASMA. The ENDOPLASMA and its accessory are supplied non-sterile and are
reusable. Cleaning/ disinfection, and sterilization (as applicable) are provided in the
respective user manual .

_(Summary) '
‘G22
The ENDOPLASMA membrane filter is also a part of the system. The filter is disposable
single-use. The filter is connected between the ENDOPLASMA (at the Argon gas port) and
connector hose. The filter creates a barrier to protect the ENDOPLASMA from potential
contamination. Filters are supplied sterile by means of ethylene oxide and are disposabie
(single use). They are sterilized by the manufacturer and the sterilization cycle has been
validated.
3) Accessories
© Foatswitch
A footswitch is provided to the physician as a means to activate a mode of the PSD-60 by
depressing a foot petal. A footswitch has two pedals. One is for cutting, and the other is
for coagulating.
@ P-cord :
P-cord is provided to connect the single use of patient plate to the PSD-60.
@ APC-cable .
APC-cable is provided to transmit HF energy and argon gas to ENDOPLASMA probe.
@ APC-probe
APC-probe is provided to mix HF energy and argon gas to form ENDOPLASMA and provide
plasma energy to the surface of tissue.
® trrigation adapter
Irrigation adapter is provided to clean the ENDOPLASMA probe.
© Pressure reducer
Pressure reducer is provided to reduce pressure provided from the gas cylinder.
@ S-cord
S-cord is provided to connect the metal part of Endoscope to the PSD-60.
2. Design
This device has been designed to be complying with the following voluntary standards.
“1EC 60601-1 + 1EC60601-1-1 > IEC 60601-1-4 * UL2601-1
“HEC 60601-2-2 + IEC 60601-1-2 (EMC) + EN60529 + AAMI/ANSI HF-18
+ IEC 60601-2-18
3. Materials
There aren't any patient contacting materials in PSD-60 and ENDOPLASMA. Some ancillary
equipment have patient contact materials, however, there are no new patient contacting
materials in those devices.
4. Intended Use of the device
The PSD-60 has been designed to be used with OLYMPUS endoscope (fiberscope, video
scope and rigid scope) compatible with electrosurgical accessories and other ancillary
equipment for general, laparoscopic and endoscopic electrosurgery ( cutting, coagulation,
including soft tissue coagulation).
ASOD

get
The argon plasma coagulation unit has been designed to be used with the electrosurgical unit,
OLYMPUS PSD-60 for argon plasma coagulation (APC) of living tissues in treatment using
OLYMPUS endoscope compatible with electrosurgery, argon plasma coagulation accessories
and other ancillary equipment for endoscopic electrosurgery (coagulation).
E. COMPARISION OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS
Theory of the operation of OLYMPUS PSD-60 and ENDOPLASMA are that the electrical
energy generation in PSD-60 is supplied to human tissue via endoscopic therapy devices in
order to cut and coagulate the human tissue. The system can cut and coagulate the human
tissue by high frequency energy. This system is equivalent to the predicate devices, ERBE
VIO300D (K023886), OLYMPUS UES-20 (K970184), ERBE VIO APC2 (K024047) and ERBE
APC300 (K963189).
F. CONCLUSION
When compared to the predicate devices, PSD-60and ENDOPLASMA do nat incorporate any
significant changes in the intended use, method of operation, materials, or design that could
affect safety and effectiveness. Therefore, clinical data is not necessary for evaluation of safaty
and efficacy.
