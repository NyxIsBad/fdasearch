Device Identification
Device Trade/Proprietary Name:
The Candela - Inolase Serenity PSF™ (Pneumatic Skin
Flattening) System
Common Name: Laser or Intense Pulse Light Handpiece Accessory System
Classification Name: Laser Surgical Instrument, for use in General and Plastic
Surgery and Dermatology
Classification Regulation: 21 CFR § 878.4810
Device Classification: 0
Identification of Predicate Device
Predicate Device(s): The Inolase Serenity PSF™ (Pneumatic Skin Flattening) System
K062589
The Candela Dynamic Cooling Device, K001589
Device Description
The Candela - Inolase Serenity PSF™ (Pneumatic Skin Flattening) System is an accessory for a
Laser or Intense Pulse Light System for their legally marketed indications. Its handpiece
produces a negative pressure over the skin surface just prior to the administration of the
treatment beam through it.
The chamber of the handpiece produces the negative pressure over the skin surface for a very
short duration just prior to firing an intense treatment light pulse or laser beam. The negative
pressure results in the flattening of the skin against a highly thermal conductive transparent
sapphire window, thereby ensuring tight mechanical contact with the window.
The Candela - Inolase Serenity PSF™ (Pneumatic Skin Flattening) System consists of a control
unit and a handpiece connected together by a 10’ flexible hose containing flexible tubing. The
ANNE 1

flexible hose has a connector at the front of the control unit and is removable by pulling a
connector while pressing a latch. The handpiece is ergonomically designed for easy use.
Description of Intended Use
The Candela - Inolase Serenity PSF™ (Pneumatic Skin Flattening) System is indicated for the
following uses:
An accessory for a compatible legally marketed Laser or Intense Pulse Light System for use in
hair removal. Its handpiece produces a negative pressure over the skin surface, just prior to the
administration of the treatment beam through it.
Reduction of pain during Laser or Intense Pulse Light System treatment.
Rationale for Substantial Equivalence
The Candela - Inolase Serenity PSF™ (Pneumatic Skin Flattening) System has the same
technological characteristics, materials, design aspects, and energy source as the currently legally
marketed Candela — Inolase Serenity PSF™ (Pneumatic Skin Flattening) System), K062589 and
the same parent device light source, indication, and clinical modality as the currently legally
marketed Candela Dynamic Cooling Device, K001589.
The Candela - Inolase Serenity PSF™ (Pneumatic Skin Flattening) System has the same intended
use and shares similar technological characteristics including methods of assembly and method
of operation as the legally marketed Inolase Serenity PSF™ (Pneumatic Skin Flattening) System,
K062589 predicate devices. Performance clinical data demonstrates that the Candela - Inolase
Serenity PSF™ (Pneumatic Skin Flattening) System does not introduce new issues of safety and
efficacy and therefore is substantially equivalent to the currently legally marketed Inolase
Serenity PSF™ (Pneumatic Skin Flattening) System, K062589 and Candela Dynamic Cooling
Device, K001589 predicate devices.
Safety and Effectiveness Information
The Candela - Inolase Serenity PSF™ (Pneumatic Skin Flattening) System is substantial
equivalent to the currently legally marketed Inolase Serenity PSF™ (Pneumatic Skin Flattening)
System, K062589 and Candela Dynamic Cooling Device, K001589 predicate devices in intended
use and technological features. Performance clinical data demonstrates that the Candela - Inolase
Serenity PSF™ (Pneumatic Skin Flattening) System does not introduce new issues of safety and
efficacy.
We therefore believe that there are no new questions of safety or effectiveness raised by the
introduction of the Candela - Inolase Serenity PSF™ (Pneumatic Skin Flattening) System.
Conclusion
Base on the similarities in indications for use, design features, and functional features the
Candela - Inolase Serenity PSF™ (Pneumatic Skin Flattening) System has been shown to be
substantially equivalent to the current legally marketed predicate devices.

‘Trade/Device Name: Candela — Inolase Serenity PSF” (Pneumatic Skin Flattening) System

Regulation Number: 21 CFR 878.4810

Regulation Name: Laser surgical instrument for use in general and plastic surgery’ and in

dermatology

Regulatory Class: IJ

Product Code: GEX

Dated: May 25, 2007

Received: May 29, 2007
Dear Mr. Roberts:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
‘This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
