Summary of the Clinical Data: Clinical data was provided to demonstrate that the
Lumenis Family of IPL and IPL/Nd:YAG laser (1064 nm) systems are safe and
effective, when indicated in specific applications in the medical specialties of general
and plastic surgery, and dermatology.
Conclusion: The Lumenis Family of Intense Pulsed-Light (IPL) and IPL/Nd:YAG
: laser systems were shown to be substantially equivalent to the predicate devices
cleared in K020839. The Lumenis Family of Intense Pulsed-Light (IPL) and
IPL/Nd:YAG laser systems has identical intended use, as well as functional and
design features as the currently marketed predicate devices. The only change is
expansion of labeled indications for use, which fall within the scope of the intended
use.

Dear Ms. Ruth:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
- may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may

or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Device Name: Lumenis Family of Intense Pulsed-Light (IPL) Systems &
Combination IPL / Nd:YAG Systems and the Real Time Chiller
Indications For Use: *Continued from Previous Page***
Nd:YAG Laser Wavelength (1064 nm):

* The coagulation and hemostasis of vascular lesions and soft tissue, including:

* Treatment and clearance of superficial and deep telangiectasias
(venulectasias) and reticular veins (0.1 - 4.0 mm diameter) of the leg; :

* The non-ablative treatment of facial wrinkles.

The Real Time Chiller is indicated for use in cooling the epidermis at the treatment site
prior to, during and after light or laser treatment in general surgery, plastic surgery and
dermatology to:

* Reduce pain during and/or associated with light or laser treatment (via partial
anesthesia from cooling); :

* Reduce discomfort during and/or associated with light or laser treatment;

* Minimize thermal injury, including thermal necrosis, to non-target skin and skin ~
structures during and/or associated with light or laser treatment, thus reducing
possible complications such as scabbing, scarring, hyper- and/or
hypopigmentation;

* Allow the use of higher light or laser fluences for light or laser treatments (such
as for hair removal and the treatment of vascular or pigmented lesions); and

* Reduce potential side effects of light or laser treatments (such as for hair removal
and the treatment of vascular or pigmented lesions).
