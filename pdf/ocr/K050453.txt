Dear Ms. Hartnett:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
{f your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class 1] (PMA).
it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device
can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA
may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter wi!l allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 51 0(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your
device to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CER Part 807.97). You may obtain

Description of Submitted Device:

The Odyssey 2.4G Diode Laser is a device for delivering laser energy to surfaces within
the oral cavity. This energy is generated by solid-state diodes, which provide a consistent and
reliable generation of laser energy at 810 + 20nm for a maximum of 5 watts of energy output.
The laser energy is delivered to the surgical site by means of a proprietary optical fiber system,
which allows for the safe transmission of laser energy to the site without creating undue risk to
the patient or operatory staff by errant or collateral laser emissions. The device features some
user definable settings, including a switchable 650nm aiming beam, adjustable power output for
both the working beam and aiming beam, and continuous delivery or pulse delivery options.

The working end of the delivery fiber is contained within a metal handpiece with a
disposable single-use tip. This handpiece system is provided with the device. Activation of the
working beam diodes is completed by use of a foot-activated switch.
a
Intended Uses of the Odyssey 2.4G Diode Laser:

The device is intended to be used for a variety of surgical procedures on soft tissue within
the oral cavity.

Dental Soft Tissue Indications:
Sulcular debridement of diseased or fibrous tissue
Excision and biopsy
Gingivectomy and gingivoplasty
Lesion (tumor) removal
Fibroma removal
Tissue retraction (troughing)
Aphthous ulcers .

Technological Characteristics and Substantial Equivalence:

The DenLaser 800 uses solid state diodes to generate laser energy in the 810nm range.
This system uses a fiber delivery system to transmit laser energy to the surgical site. The system
also features a 630nm aiming beam and features controls that allow for adjusting the output of
the working beam, and switching between a continuous or pulsed-mode laser emission. The
maximum output of the unit 5 watts.

The Opus 10 Diode Laser uses solid-state diodes to generate laser energy in the infrared
region. The system features timing controls that allows for variation in duration or intervals of
laser emissions. This system also features a 630-650nm aiming beam.

The Aurora Laser System uses solid-state diodes to generate laser energy in the infrared
region. This system features similar power output, spot size, and equivalent pulse duration to that
of the submitted device.

The LaserSmile System uses solid state diodes to generate laser energy in the infrared
region. The system features similar power output to that of the submitted device.

/ Performance Standards:

The Odyssey 2.4G Diode Laser complies with the performance requirements of 21 CFR
1040.10 and 1040.11, with permissible deviations relative to Laser Notice 50, dated July 26,
2001. The device also complies with IEC 60601-1:1998+A1, IEC 60601-2-22:1995, and IEC
60825-1:1993+A1+A2. The device also complies with FCC regulations Part 15 for wireless
devices.
