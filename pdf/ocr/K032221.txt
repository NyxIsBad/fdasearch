Indications: The Adept 1064/755 Laser is indicated for coagulation and hemostasis of vascular
lesions and removal and permanent reduction of unwanted hair in Fitzpatrick skin
types I - VI, including suntanned skin types. Permanent hair reduction is defined
as a long-term stable reduction in the number of hairs regrowing after a treatment
regimen.

The Adept 1064/755 Laser is intended for:
755 nm wavelength
The coagulation and hemostasis of vascular lesions and the removal and permanent
reduction of unwanted hair in Fitzpatrick skin types I - VI, including suntanned skin
types.
1064 nm wavelength
General Surgical Applications:
For the incision, excision, coagulation, hemostasis, vaporization, and/or ablation of
soft tissue in dermatology/plastic surgery, endoscopic/laparoscopic general surgery,
gastroenterology, general surgery, gynecology, head and neck/otorhinolaryngology
(ENT), neurosurgery, oculoplastics, orthopedics, pulmonary surgery, thoracic
surgery, and urology.
Dermatology/Plastic Surgery:
For photocoagulation and hemostasis of benign vascular lesions such as, but not
limited to, port wine stains, hemangiomas, warts, telangiectasia, rosacea, venus lake,
leg and spider veins. In addition, the Adept 1064/755 Laser is intended for the
treatment of benign, pigmented lesions such as, but not limited to, lentigos (age
spots), solar lentigos (sun spots). café au lait macules, seborrheic keratoses, nevi,
chloasma, verrucae, skin tags, keratoses, tattoos (significant reduction in the
intensity of blue and/or black tattoos) and plaques.
The Adept 1064/755 Laser is also indicated for pigmented lesions to reduce lesion
size, for patients with lesions that would potentially benefit from aggressive
treatment, and for patients with lesions that have not responded to other laser
treatments.
Cutting, incision, excision, hemostasis, coagulation, vaporization, and ablation of
soft tissue in dermatology and plastic surgery.
For the treatment of facial wrinkles and wrinkles such as, but not limited to,
periocular and periorbital wrinkles.

071

reduction through selective targeting of melanin in hair follicles, and for the
treatment for pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB).
For the reduction of red pigmentation in hypertrophic and keloid scars where
vascularity is an integral part of the scar.
For the removal and permanent reduction of unwanted hair in Fitzpatrick skin types
I - VI, including suntanned skin types.
Endoscopic/Laparoscopic Surgery:
For use in a variety of surgical procedures in several surgical specialties. These
include, but are not limited to, cholecystectomy, appendectomy, vagotomy, and
pyloromyomotomy where its abilities to incise, excise, coagulate, vaporize, or ablate
soft tissue may be applied.
General Surgery:
For incision, excision, vaporization, ablation, and hemostasis of soft tissue general
surgery applications, skin incisions, tissue dissection, excision of external tumors
and lesions, complete or partial resection of internal organs, tumors, lesions, tissue
ablation, vessel coagulation, tonsillectomy, and hemorrhoids.
Gynecology: /
For the treatment of menorrhagia by photocoagulation of the endometrial lining of
the uterus, ablation of endometrial implants and/or peritoneal adhesions, soft tissue
excisional procedures such as excisional conization of the cervix, intrauterine
gynecologic procedures where cutting, ablation, and/or vessel coagulation may be
indicated including submucous fibroids, benign endometrial polyps, and uterine
septum.
Head and Neck/-Otorhinolaryngology (ENT):
For tissue incision, excision, ablation, and vessel hemostasis.
Hemostasis During Surgery: .
For adjunctive coagulation and hemostasis (bleeding control) during surgery in
endoscopic (e.g. laparoscopic) and open procedures.
Neurosurgery:
For hemostasis for pituitary tumor, meningioma, hemagioblastoma, AVMs.
glioblastoma, astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma.

0"

Oculoplastics:
For incision, excision, vaporization, and/or coagulation of tissues in oculoplastic
procedures such as operations on the lacrimal system, operation on the eyelids,
removal of biopsy or orbital tumors, enucleation on eyeball, exteneration of orbital
contents.
Pulmonary Surgery:
For palliative treatment of benign and malignant pulmonary airway obstructions,
including squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, carcinoid, benign tumors,
granulomas, and benign strictures.
Thoracic Surgery:
For cutting (incision/excision), coagulating, and vaporization of soft tissue.
Thoracic applications, including but not limited to, isolation of vessels for
endarterectomy and/or by-pass grafts, wedge resections, thoractomy, formation of
pacemaker pockets; vaporization, coagulation, incision/excision, debulking, and
ablation of lung tissue (thoracoscopy).
Urology:
For all applications including superficial urinary bladder tumors, invasive bladder
carcinoma, urethral strictures and lesions of the external genitalia (including
condyloma acuminata).
Orthopedics:
For cutting, ablation, and/or hemostasis of intra-articular tissue in orthopedic
surgical and arthroscopic applications.
Performance Data: None required. The claim of substantial equivalence is based on comparisons
of specifications/characteristics and intended uses of the claimed predicate.
Conclusion: Based on the information in the notification Adept Medical Concepts, Inc., believes
that the Adept 1064/755 Laser is substantially equivalent to the claimed
predicate(s) - see listing above for the indications for use as listed.

Dear Mr. McFarland:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
