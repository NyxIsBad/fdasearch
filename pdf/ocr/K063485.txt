INDICATIONS FOR USE:
Surgical Innovations Resposable Laparoscopic Scissors are designed to cut,
dissect, manipulate and/or cauterize various tissue during
endoscopic/laparoscopic, general, vascular gynaecological and thoracic surgical
procedures.
SUMMARY STATEMENT:
Surgical Innovations Resposable Laparoscopic Scissors are designed to cut,
dissect, manipulate and/or cauterize various tissue during
endoscopic/laparoscopic, general, vascular gynaecological and thoracic surgical
procedures. The Logic Resposable Laparoscopic Scissors consist of a reusable
handle and disposable insulated shaft with scissor blades. The device has a 5mm
diameter disposable insulated shaft that connects to a reusable
Polyenylsulfone/stainless steel handle with a male cautery connector to be utilised
for monopolar cautery when attached to standard monopolar cautery cables and
their generators.
The disposable shaft consists of an aluminium outer shaft housing a
stainless steel actuation rod, which connects to the scissor blades and
handle actuation rod. The disposable shaft is to be supplied sterile in
single unit pouches. The scissors will be available in working lengths of
24cm, 32cm and 42cm.

The reusable handle is steam sterilized by the user and then connected to
the sterile disposable shaft. Following use the shaft and handle are
disassembled. The shaft is disposed of and the handle is cleaned and resterilised.
The device is in compliance with ISO 10993 for Biocompatibility. The
Logic Laparoscopic Scissors shaft is sterilised using gamma irradiation
which provides a sterility assurance level of 10°.
The Laparoscopic Scissor handle is provided non-sterile. Sterilisation
instructions are provided in the instructions for use. The Surgical
Innovations steam sterilisation and cleaning validation methods are based
on the AAMI TIR No 12-1994, Designing, Testing and Labelling Reusable
Devices for Reprocessing in Health Care Facilities: A Guide for Device
Manufactures and proves a sterility assurance level of 10°. Sterilisation
validation of the steam sterilisations is based on three sterilisation cycles
at one half the exposure time. The use of Bacillus sterothermophilus
spore strips or inoculum is the utilised indicator.
The Logic Resposable Laparoscopic Scissors are substantially equivalent
the Applied Medical Laparoscopic Monopolar Scissors which is cleared to
market under premarket notification KO40295 and the Aesculap
Resposable Instrument System which is cleared to market under
premarket notification KO014207 in terms of intended use, design and use
methodology and are manufactured from similar materials.
Surgical Innovations is the manufacturer of the device and has followed
design controt regulations per 21 CFR § 820.30. The design controls have
been in place since 1998 and have been audited by FDA on several
occasions. The design of the Logic Resposable Laparoscopic Scissors was
within the Surgical Innovations Design Control System.
A design Risk Assessment was conducted in accordance with Surgical
Innovations internal Stand Operating Procedures, ISO 9001/ISO 13485,
ISO 14971 and 21 CFR § 820.30, validation and verification activities
addressed in the profile. Based on the risk analysis, validation and
verification activities were formally controlled and addressed by Surgical
Innovations, the activities included the methods, tests used and
acceptance criteria applied.
REVIEW OF PERFORMANCE DATA
Cutting performance
It is essential that laparoscopic scissors are sharp, are capable of
withstanding electrocautery (diathermy) energy transfer, and are
suitable for cutting a range of tissue types. Furthermore, Surgical
Innovations has undertaken a range of bench tests to determine
the cutting performance and compliance with the ASTM Standards.
The sharpness of the scissors is standardised in ASTM F1079-87
(1993). TN100047 summaries the testing undertaken and
demonstrates compliance with ASTM F1079-87 (1993).
The cutting life of the scissors is also important and TN100046
demonstrates a life 2,400 cuts into latex rubber (generally
regarded as an indicator of the sharpness of a product.
510(k} Summary for Laparoscopic Monopolar Scissors - Surgical Innovations Group

Therefore, the Logic Resposable Scissors comply with ASTM1079
and have a life deemed to be sufficient to cope with almost all
laparoscopic procedures.
Electrical Safety
The electrical safety of the product is paramount. Both the scissor
shaft and handle have been tested in accordance with EN60601-2-2
and EN60601-2-18 (see TN100048, TN100055 and TN100034
respectively).
In conclusion the complete device is deemed to be compliant with
the relevant parts of EN60601 and therefore deemed safe.
Temperature Performance

The performance of the insulation is also very important. This can
be damaged by excessive heat. The heat generation resulting of
excessive coagulation was investigated in TN100044 and
TN100049. The performance of the insulation was deemed to be
sufficient to withstand excessive heat generation during surgery.

Conclusion

It can be concluded from the above bench testing that the product performs well

and is fit for purpose.

Dear Mr. Lehtonen:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
