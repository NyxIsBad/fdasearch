DEVICE DESCRIPTION:
The ezlase™ 10W dental diode laser system may be used to perform various dental soft tissue
applications. The system uses advanced laser technology to incise, excise, vaporize, coagulate and
ablate intraoral soft tissues. An Indium Gallium Arsenide Phosphorus solid-state laser diode emits
infrared laser energy to the various oral soft tissues targeted during a procedure. This energy is
transmitted via a flexible fiberoptic cable to the handpiece that emits the energy to the targeted
tissue site. A visible light is emitted at the same time to visually pinpoint the treatment location.
The power output and pulse width may be adjusted to specific user requirements.

Incision, excision, vaporization, ablation and coagulation of oral soft tissues, including
marginal and inter-dental gingival and epithelial lining of free gingiva and the following
specific indications:
» Excisional and incisional biopsies
> Exposure of unerupted teeth
> Fibroma removal
>» Frenectomy
> Frenotomy
>» Gingival troughing for crown impressions
» Gingivectomy
>  Gingivoplasty
» Gingival incision and excision
>» Hemostasis and coagulation
>» Implant recovery
>» Incision and drainage of abscess
>  Leukoplakia
» Operculectomy
» Oral papillectomies
> Pulpotomy
» Pulpotomy as an adjunct to root canal therapy
» Reduction of gingival hypertrophy
» Soft tissue crown lengthening
>» Treatment of canker sores, herpetic and aphthous ulcers of the oral mucosa
>  Vestibuloplasty
Laser Periodontal procedures, including:
>» Laser soft tissue curettage
> Laser removal of diseased, infected, inflamed and necrosed soft tissue within the
periodontal pocket
» Sulcular debridement (removal of diseased, infected, inflamed and necrosed soft
tissue in the periodontal pocket to improve clinical indices including gingival index,
gingival bleeding index, probe depth, attachment loss and tooth mobility.)
CONTRAINDICATIONS:
All clinical procedures performed with the ezlase™ ZOW must be subjected to the same clinical
judgment and care as with traditional techniques. Patient risk must always be considered and fully
understood before clinical treatment. The clinician must completely understand the patient’s
medical history prior to treatment. Exercise caution for general medical conditions, which might
contraindicate a local procedure. Such conditions may include allergy to local or topical
anesthetics, heart disease, lung disease, bleeding disorders, sleep apnea, and immune system
deficiency, or any medical conditions or medications that may contraindicate use of certain

light/laser type sources associated with this device. Medical clearance from the patient’s physician
is advisable when doubt exists regarding treatment.
CONCLUSION:
There are no new indications requested for this device in this Special 510(k). Substantial
equivalency for the ezlase™ JOW has been determined through comparison to previously cleared
devices.

Dear Ms. Rizoiu:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the cnactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class I] (Special Controls) or class ITI (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labcling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
