DEVICE DESCRIPTION:

Predicate Devices:

Suncoast Medical Manufacturing Replace-a-Tip Cautery K840434

Pyro Tip K841591

Modern Medical Battery Powered Cautery K023506

Busse Hospital Disposables Suture Removal Kit Pre-Amendment
Powertron Medical Devices Battery Pack Exempt

Medline Industries Gauze Exempt

Medline Industries Forceps Exempt

INTENDED USE:

The Bovie inaFlash™ Suture Remover is used to perform suture removal procedures in health
care facilities and veterinary offices. The suture removal procedures include those in which the
sutures are located externally on the surface of the skin.

DEVICE COMPONENTS AND OPERATION:

The Suture Remover consists of a rechargeable power handle, charging stand, and a sterile,
single-use kit distributed in a multipack. The single-use kit includes three components, two of
which are Class I devices (forceps and gauze) commonly used in predicate suture removal kits.
The forceps and gauze components are substantially equivalent to those included in other Class I,
Premarket notification-exempt devices. The single-use tip component is included in the sterile kit.
After the handle is charged, the tip is attached to the power handle. The bottom of the tip is
placed flat against the sutured skin surface so that the tip filament only touches the suture. The
button is pressed, delivering heat to the filament for about 0.5 second prior to deactivating. This
process is completed for all sutures, after which the suture threads are easily removed using the
supplied forceps. Using a heated filament to cut the suture provides an advantage over the use of
scissors to cut the suture because pulling of the suture prior to the cut is minimized.

The suture removal handle and cutting tip use technology substantially equivalent to the Suncoast
Medical Replace-A-Tip Cautery (K840434), the Suncoast Medical Pyro Tip (K841591), and the
Modern Medical Battery Powered Cautery (K023506). Replaceable tips for all devices are singleuse and are activated after pushing a button on the handle. Whereas the predicate devices use
replaceable alkaline batteries, the Bovie Suture Cutter handle utilizes a rechargeable battery pack.
The Modem Medical Battery Powered Cautery_(K023506) was also found substantially _
equivalent for the use of sculpting (cutting and shaping to fit) woven grafts. These grafts are
constructed of polyethylene matérials similar to those of suture material.
Electromagnetic Compatibility testing in accordance with EN 60601-1-2 was successfully
performed. Hazard analysis evaluations were also performed for the Suture Remover. There are
no new hazards presented with the use of the Suture Cutter as compared with predicate devices.

Dear Mr. Kozloff
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class Il (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
