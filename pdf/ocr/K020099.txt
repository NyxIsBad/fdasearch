Dear Dr. Morello:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) notification of intent to market the device referenced
above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent to devices marketed in
interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device
Amendments or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to
the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include
requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling,
and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (Premarket Approval), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations
affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 895.
A substantially equivalent determination assumes compliance with the Good Manufacturing
Practice for Medical Devices: General (GMP) regulation (21 CFR Part 820) and that, through
periodic GMP inspections, FDA will verify such assumptions. Failure to comply with the GMP
. regulation may result in regulatory action. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register. Please note:
this response to your premarket notification submission does not affect any obligation you might
have under sections 531 through 542 of the Act for devices under the Electronic Product
Radiation Control provisions, or other Federal laws or regulations.

not promote or in any way represent your device or its labeling as being approved by FDA.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801 and
additionally 809.10 for in vitro diagnostic devices), please contact the Office of Compliance at
