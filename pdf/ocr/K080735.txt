Summary of Substantial Equivalence:

Compared with already cleared device Cryo V6.0, at CryoMini mechanical

: dimensions and placement on the electronic board changed. The smaller device size
is well tested and proofed by reasonable people. Also the electronic safety test and
functionality is tested and verified.
Equal to Cryo V6.0 mechanical and electrical safety of Cryo V6.0 are tested against
the standards UL60601-1 and IEC60601-1-2.
The effectiveness is tested by an air flow measurement at Zimmer Medizinsysteme
GmbH. The measurement shows that the maximum output air flaw of CryoMini is
higher than air flow of Cryo V6.0 but also the minimum air temperature is higher than
in Cryo V6.0. Some more tests show that similar to Cryo V6.0 the necessary therapy
skin temperature is reached with CryoMini also.
The Zimmer CryoMini is substantially equivalent to the compared device on the basis
of similarities in operating principles, intended use and functional performance.

Summary of fundamental technology:
The modifications have not altered the fundamental technology of predicate device
the Cryo V6.0.

Dear Stefan Preiss:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class I] (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115, Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
