The Hemostatix Model 2400Z Thermal Scalpel System is a surgical instrument
designed to retain the precise, clean cutting characteristics of the traditional steel
scalpel and to minimize blood loss by simultaneously sealing blood vessels as they are
cut, with minimum tissue damage and virtually no muscle stimulation, using heat
thermally conducted to the tissue from an elevated-temperature blade.
The Hemostatix Model 2400Z Thermal Scalpel System that is described in this
notification has the same technological characteristics, power modality and mode of
operation as the predicate device. The intended uses are substantially equivalent to
the described predicate Oximetrix Shaw Hemostatic Surgical System. The Hemostatix
Mode! 2400Z Thermal Scalpel System is designed to meet UL 2601-1 including
Australian deviations, CSA 22.2 No. 601, IEC 601-1-1 (EN 60601-1), IEC 601-1-2 (EN
60601-1-2), IEC 601-1-4 (EN 60601-1-2), IEC 61000-4-2, IEC 61000-4-3, {EC 61000-44, IEC 61000-4-5, IEC 529, ISO 10993-1, EN 55011, Class B. \
The Hemostatix Model 2400Z Thermal Scalpel System is substantially equivalent
to the Oximetrix Shaw Hemostatic Surgical System and the difference of the
processors that control the units should not affect the safety or effectiveness of
the device.
