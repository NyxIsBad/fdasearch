2. Names
Device Name: Clareblend LED Probe
Model # 7201-415, 7204-631, 7205-830
Classification Name: Laser instrument, surgical, powered device; GEX, ILY
FDA Class II category
Although this device is not a laser, the specifications developer
feels this is the closest applicable classification name.
3. Predicate Device
Clareblend LED Probes Models 7201-415, 7204-631, 7205-830 are substantially equivalent to Omnilux Blue
(K030883), Omnilux Revive (K030426), Omnilux Plus (K043317)
4. Device Description
The Clareblend Probes are hand held devices that utilizes Light Emitting Diodes to provide LED light to the
body. The hand hold device contains the power supply. The probe will be simply activated by an alternate
action ON/OFF pushbutton switch which is located on the top of the probe. The probe when activated applies
full power (100% duty cycle). The OFF button is provided for the user to immediately remove all power to
the probes. The probe housing is 100% machined aluminum and has a recessed clear lexan window. The
device delivers the light to the skin as it moves over the skin. The output is pre-tuned to one wavelength with
a narrow spectral bandwidth. The output wavelength of Red is 631 +/- 4nm, IR is 830 +/- Snm and Blue is
415 +/- 5nm.
5. Indications for Use:
Clareblend Probe (Red-631) is generally indicated for the treatment of superficial, benign vascular and
pigmented lesions
Clareblend Probe (Blue-415) is generally indicated for the treatment of dermatological conditions and
specially indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate inflammatory acne vulgaris,
Clareblend Probe (IR-830) is generally indicated for the temporary relief of minor muscle and joint pain,
arthritis and muscle spasm, relieving stiffness; promoting the relaxation of muscle tissue; and to temporarily
increase loca! blood circulation where applied.

6. Comparison of Technological Differences: Ko ? 5G AL
The intended use and technological characteristics of the Clareblend Probes are virtually identical to the
intended use and technological characteristics of the listed equivalent devices. Any differences between the
Clareblend Probes and the equivalent devices have no significant influence on safety or effectiveness of the
Clareblend Probes product.

7, Conclusions
Based upon an analysis of the overall performance characteristics for the Clareblend Probes, Clareblend, Inc.
believes that no significant differences exist between this system and the predicate systems quoted, therefore,
the Clareblend Probes do not impose any new safety or effectiveness concerns.

Regulation Number: 21 CFR 878.4810
Regulation Name: Laser surgical instrument for use in general and plastic
/ surgery and in dermatology
Regulatory Class: II
Product Code: GEX, ILY
Dated: September 15, 2008
Received: September 18, 2008 Dear Ms. Creasy:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class IIT (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register. .
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
. that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Aliso, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance
at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address
