Classification Panel
Classification of this device would fall under the responsibility of the Division of General, Restorative,
and Neurological Devices.
Class :
Classification: Class 2
Product Code: GEI, 21 CFR 878.4400
Predicate Device [21 CFR 807.92(a)(3)]
The predicate devices are listed as follows:
e Ellman Electrodes — Preamendment
Description of the Device [21 CFR 807.92(a)(4)}
Eliman has been manufacturing and distributing electrodes for many years. The Ellman electrodes are
used with an electrosurgical generator (such as Ellman Surgi Max K061174, Ellman Surgitron
K052241). The electrical power operating at radio frequency (RF) is transferred to tissue at the surgical site. The time-varying voltage produced by the RF electrical power source yields a predetermined
electrosurgical effect, such as tissue cutting or coagulation.
The Ellman family of electrodes are available in various shapes and sizes depending on the need of
the surgeon.
The Ace-Tip electrodes are composed of the new noble alloy. Several of the classical Ellman electrodes are now available in the new noble alloy including:
o Loop Electrode 3mm and 5mm
© Micro Incision Needle Electrode
o Ball Electrode 2mm
o Tapered Ball Electrode 3mm
o Fine Wire Electrode
© VariTip Electrode

f 2D @

Intended Use [21 CFR 807.92(a)(5)]
The electrodes are accessories to the Ellman electrosurgical generators for cutting of tissue and coagulation by
use of high frequency electrical current.
Technological Characteristics [21 CFR 807.92(a)(6)] .
The device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device based on a comparison on physical and performance characteristics.
Performance Data [21 CFR 807.92(b)(1)}
The subject device is composed of biocompatible materials, has passed dielectric testing, and performs similarly to the predicate device.
Conclusion [21 CFR 807.92(b)(3)]
We believe the changes are minor and conclude that the subject devices are as safe and effective as the predicate device.

Dear Mr. Azary:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class H (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with al] the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 — Mr. Joseph M. Azary
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
