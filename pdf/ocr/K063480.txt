Registration No.: 3005182723
Trade Name: Stryker RF Intradiscal Adapter
Common Name: Electrosurgical Connecting Cable
Classification Name: Generator, Radiofrequency Lesion (GXD)
Equivalent to: K033981 Smith & Nephew ElectroThermal 20S Spine Generator
Device Description: The Stryker RF Intradiscal Adaptor when used with the separately cleared
Stryker RF Generator and the separately cleared Smith & Nephew
SPINECATH™ |ntradiscal Catheter(K993967) and ACUTHERM ™
Decompression Catheter or equivalent. The Stryker RF Intradiscal Adaptor
is intended for the coagulation and decompression of disc material to treat
symptomatic patients with annular disruption of contained herniated discs.
indications for Use: The Stryker RF Intradiscal Adapter is intended for the coagulation and
decompression of disc material to treat symptomatic patients with annular
disruption of contained herniated discs. The Adapter will be used with the
previously cleared Stryker Intradiscal RF Generator and catheters such as
Smith & Nephew SPINECATH™ & Acutherm™ catheters.
Contraindications: The contraindications for the Stryker RF Intradiscal Adapter would be the
same as those for the catheter to which it is attached. The contraindications
included in the instructions for use for the Smith & Nephew
SPINECATH™™ Intradiscal Catheter and ACUTHERM ™ Decompression
Catheter are:
Use of the SPINECATH™ intradiscal Catheter is not appropriate for treating
patients who present pain that is suspected to originate from structures
other than contained herniated discs, or when free fragments or severe bony
Stenosis are present. In addition, patients presenting severely degenerative
or disrupted discs should be excluded.
and
Use of the Decompression Catheter is not appropriate for treating patients
who present pain that is suspected to originate from origins other than
herniated discs, or when free fragments or severe spinal stenosis are
present, In addition, patients presenting with severely degenerative or
disrupted discs should be excluded.
Use of the Smith & Nephew SPINECATH™™ intradiscal Catheter and
ACUTHERM ™ Decompression Catheter is appropriate for treating patients

with herniations of intervertebral discs who would typically undergo
automated or laser percutaneous lumbar discectomy.

Use of the Smith & Nephew SPINECATH™™ intradiscal Catheter and
ACUTHERM ™ Decompression Catheter is appropriate for treating patients
with herniations of intervertebral discs who would typically undergo
automated or laser percutaneous lumbar discectomy.

Precautions: Patients taking steroids and patients with pacemakers, lupus, gout,
uncontrolled diabetes, Ehiers-Danios syndrome, prior open capsular
procedures, autoimmune disease, or etiologies where their immune systems
are compromised require special consideration.

Substantial Equivalence

(SE) Rational: The Stryker intradiscal RF Generator has a similar intended use as:
¢ Smith & Nephew ElectroTherma! 20S Spine Generator (K033981)
© Smith & Nephew SPINECATH™ catheters (Oratec K993867)

« Neurotherm NT1000 RF Lesioning System (K052878)
Stryker claims this equivalence because the Stryker RF Intradiscal Adapter
has an equivalent intended use, modes of operation, protocols for use, and
quality check mechanisms as compared to the predicate devices.
Furthermore, the Stryker RF Intradiscal Adapter has equivalent
technological characteristics as compared to the predicate devices.
Safety and Effectiveness: Based upon the comparison to the predicate devices, the Stryker RF
Intradiscal Adapter is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device.

Dear Ms. Sheppard:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for
use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce
prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good
manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class If] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply
with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part
807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the
quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product
radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
