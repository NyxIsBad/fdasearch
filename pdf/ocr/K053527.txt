System Description: The Spectra Hair Removal System consists of the
Spectra Laser and Spectra Skin Sensor. The Spectra
Hair Removal Laser is a semiconductor diode laser
system that delivers infrared light at a wavelength
of nominally 800 nm. The Spectra Skin Sensor
determines whether users can safely use the Spectra
Hair Removal Laser.

Intended Use of the Device: The Spectra Hair Removal Laser System is an overthe-counter device intended for adjunctive use with

/ - shaving for hair removal sustained with periodic
treatments.

Performance Data: The specifications and indications for use of the
Spectra Hair Removal Laser System are
substantially equivalent to those claimed in the
clearance for the above-listed predicate devices.
Clinical data is provided to demonstrate the safety
and efficacy of the Spectra Hair Removal Laser
System in a simulated home-use environment to
support the over-the-counter clearance.

Conclusion: The Spectra Hair Removal Laser System is
substantially equivalent to the legally-marketed
claimed predicate devices for the purposes of this
510(k) submission.

Dear Dr. Grove:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class IE (Special Controls) or class IH] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 — Robert E. Grove, Ph.D.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, “Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
