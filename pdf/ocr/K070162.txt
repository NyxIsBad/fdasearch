Common/Classification Name: Electrosurgical Cutting and Coagulation Device
* and Accessories
3. Predicate Devices
The ForceTriad™ Electrosurgical Generator is substantially equivalent to the following
legally marketed medical devices:
e ForceTriad™ Electrosurgical Generator (K051644)
4, Device Description
The ForceTriad™ generator is a full-featured electrosurgical generator with monopolar,
bipolar, and Valleylab LigaSure™ vessel sealing outputs. This 510(k) only applies to the
LigaSure™ Vessel sealing portion of the generator. The generator is electrically
isolated, microcontroller-based device, incorporating closed-loop control for all output
modes implemented in the microcontroller firmware. The generator incorporates Instant
Response™ technology to constantly measure the electrical impedance of the tissue
and instantaneously adjust the generator output to maintain the desired power.
The generator is used with a selection of instruments designed for use with the
ForceTriad and the LigaSure Vessel Sealing generator. All of the instruments are
capable of sealing vessels up to, and including, 7mm, and tissue bundles as large as
can fit in the jaws of each instrument. When a LigaSure™ instrument is applied to a
vessel or tissue bundle and RF energy is applied, the collagen and elastin in the tissues
are reformed by heat and pressure to fuse vessel walls, thereby forming a permanent
seal. The microprocessor in the generator monitors the tissue properties, stops the

application of energy, and allows a brief period of cooling before indicating thatthe seal
cycle is complete.

No changes are being made to the design or operation of any of the devices within the
current system. The change as proposed in this 510(k) notification is to the intended
use as described above and the resulting labeling changes.

5. Intended Use
The ForceTriad™ is a full-featured electrosurgical generator intended for open and
laparoscopic surgical procedures where the surgeon requires electrosurgical cutting,
coagulation, or vessel sealing (tissue fusion). The generator is intended for use in
general, laparoscopic and gynecologic surgical procedures where ligation of vessels,
pulmonary vasculature, or lymph vessels, is desired. The system creates a vessel
ligation (sea!) by the application of bipolar electrosurgical RF energy (coagulation) to

/ vessels interposed between the jaws of the device. The generator can also be used
with standard bipolar devices where bipolar cutting or coagulation is desired.
The indications for use include general (including urologic, thoracic, plastic and
reconstructive), laparoscopic, and gynecological procedures where electrosurgical
. cutting and coagulation of tissue, and sealing (fusion) of vessels, including pulmonary

vessels, and tissue bundles is performed, including such procedures as bowel
resections, hysterectomies (both vaginal and abdominal), laparoscopic
cholesystectomies, laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomies, gall bladder
procedures, Nissen fundoplication, adhesiolysis, oophorectomy, etc. The devices can
be used on vessels (arteries, veins, pulmonary arteries, pulmonary veins, lymph) up to
7mm and bundles as large as will fit in the jaws of the instruments.
The LigaSure tissue fusion function has not been shown to be effective for tubal
sterilization or tubal coagulation for sterilization procedures. Do not use this function for
these procedures.

6. Summary of Technological Characteristics
The technological characteristics of the ForceTriad Electrosurgical generator have not
been modified.

7. Performance and Clinica! Data
Pre-ctinical studies (acute and chronic) and bench testing have shown that the
ForceTriad Electrosurgical Generator effectively seals pulmonary vasculature, producing
seals with burst pressures substantially greater than the physiologic pressures in the
vessels.

Dear Mr. Ake:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration. ;
If your device is classified (see above) into either class I] (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,

- "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
