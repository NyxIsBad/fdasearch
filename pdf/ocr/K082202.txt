8. Substantial] Equivalence

The HALO®6 Energy Generator model 1100C-115B (software version
V4.5) and the predicate devices HALO#%6° Energy Generator model 1100C-115B
(software version 4.2), and Stellartech Energy Generator 2 have the same intended
use, indications for use, technological characteristics, and principles of operation.
The technological differences between the HALO360 Energy Generator model 1100C115B software version 4.5 and its predicates are:

* Modification of the coagulation catheter operating pressure

The differences were evaluated on bench and did not raise questions
regarding safety and efficacy. Thus the devices are equivalent.
