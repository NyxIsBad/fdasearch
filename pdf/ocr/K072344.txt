Common Name: Medical Laser System
Classification Name: Instrument, surgical, powered, laser
GEX and FTC

Equivalent Device: MSq(M2) LTD - Lovely System (k042000 and k033946)
Device Description: The portable device APL MEDICAL SYSTEM, is a multilaser and pulsed light system, designated to act on the most
diffused imperfections of the skin and body. The
equipmentm is conceived as an expandable system for the
field of aesthetic medicine, composed of a modular
platform, containing the entire electronics of the system and
the cooling circuit, and a series of interchangeable hand
pieces to be connected on the platform, finalized to treat
specific groups of imperfections. A rapid connection
enables the quick and easy replacement of the various hand
pieces that can be mounted on the modular platform. The
following hand pieces are available:
1) Hand piece Pulsed Light. With the use of this hand piece
the removal of unwanted hair is extremely quick and
efficient, as it is possible to treat large areas (up to 9
cm2) using a single pulse or “burst” mode This system
is effective on varius skin types. On this hand piece it is
possible to change easily the guide light, equipped with
a specific light filter and to use thus that one most
adequate for the individual photo type. Furthermore, it is

possible to conduct a combination of methods to
attenuate facial skin imperfections related to small
perorbital and labial wrinkles. With the use of guide
lights within the spectrum 300-380 nm it is possible to
treat psoriasis and vitiligo disease with a specific
therapy. This technique has the advantage of acting
directly on the concerned area while respecting the
surrounding tissues.

2) Hand piece Nd:Yag Laser at 1064nm, long pulse (ms).
With this laser it is possible to treat teleangectasies
easyly and quickly with optimal results and without
leaving a cicatrix. Furthermore, it is possible to hair
removal on small areas with “difficult” skin and hairs.

3) Hand piece Nd:Yag Laser 1064 and 532 nm Qs (Qswitched), short pulse (ns). This laser is able to
selectively destroy melanosomes through cell lysis. The
Qs laser is ideal for the treatment of pigmentated lesions
and in general for all superficial pigmentations, since its
wavelength is well absorbed by the melanin as well as
by the haemoglobin. Furthermore, the pulse width
makes this type of laser selective with regards to
melanosomes -i.e. benign freckles, ephelis, café-au-lait
stains, nervus pilus, seborrheic keratosis and skin
chloasm, and tattoos. Fin and superficial vessels are
better treated with the Nd:Yag laser 532 nm Qs which
causes less pain than other laser types, completing the
treatment which may effect the Nd:Yag laser, long
pulse.

4) Hand piece Erbium Laser at 2.940 nm. Due to the high
power and the exclusive guide light, the use of this laser
results in the ablation process which is a delicate and
uniform exfoliation of the atrophic superficial (5
micron) layer of the skin.

Intended Use: The APL MEDICAL SYSTEM is indicate for: removal of
unwanted hair and to effect stable long-term or permanent
hair reduction; laser skin procedures for the treatment of
acne scars and wrinkles; incision, excision, ablation,
vaporization of soft tissue; non-ablative treatment of facial
wrinkles, such as, but not limited to periocular wrinkles and
perioral wrinkles; removal of tattoos and blemishes of the
skin, the treatment of various pigmentation lesions,
treatment of capillaries, teleangiectasies and vascular
lesions, the treatment of vitiligo and psoriasis.

Rationale for Substancial The product specification, functionality, indication for use,

Equivalence: and treatment parameters of the APL MEDICAL SYSTEM
are the same or very similar to the legally marketed laser
MSq(M2) LTD - Lovely System Model: Lovely II
Harmony.
Both systems have the same indication for use.
Both systems comprise a flashlamp pumped laser rod
(Nd:YAG) generating light at a wavelength of 1064 nm,
which is subsequently delivered to the patient via an optical
fiber delivery system, and focusing handpiece.
The APL MEDICAL SYSTEM output characteristics
(including pulse duration and fluence) are identical, or very
similar, to those of the predicate device.
Both lasers utilize class IIIA aiming beams.
Both lasers are microprocessor controlled devices.
Both systems utilize an internal closed loop water-air heath
exchanger circuit for optimal thermal control of laser cavity
The risks and benefits for the APL MEDICAL SYSTEM are
comparable to those for the predicate device. Therefore, the
introduction of this laser should not raise new questions of
Safety and Effectiveness .

Dear Mr. Casalino:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
