Dear Mr. Patel:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for
use stated in the enclosure) to Jegally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce
prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good
manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA). it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may

or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply
with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR
Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in

Page 2—Mr. Jay M. Patel . . ‘the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product
. -radiation contro provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050. .
soe This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 5 10(k)

. marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
