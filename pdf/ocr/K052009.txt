Proprietary Name: CONMED System 2450 ESU
Common Name: Electrosurgical Unit and Accessories
Classification Name: —_ Electrosurgical Cutting and Coagulation Device and accessories
21 CFR 878.4400 79 GEl
Predicate Device: CONMED Sabre 2400 ESU, K905654, cleared March 18, 1991
CONMED System 5000 ESU, K020186, cleared April 12, 2002
Valleylab Force FX™ ESU, K944602, cleared June 5, 1995
Device Description: The System 2450 is an electrosurgical generator with the basic modes of
operation being conventional electrosurgical cutting and coagulation. When cutting, the edge of the
electrode is drawn across the tissue while electrosurgical energy is being applied. When coagulating,
the accessory electrode may be held in contact with the tissue for desiccation or separated from the
tissue by distance for fulguration to achieve the desired result. The device consists of an
electrosurgical generator unit to supply high frequency (HF) electrosurgical current to accessory
handpieces to produce the therapeutic effect. The device utilizes previously cleared/marketed and
required accessories.
Intended Use of Device: The System 2450 is a general-purpose electrosurgical generator used in
conjunction with an electrosurgical accessory handpiece for delivery of RF (radio frequency)
electrosurgical current through an accessory electrode for cutting and coagulation at the operative
site.
Technological Characteristics: The proposed device is equivalent to the identified predicate devices
with respect to technological characteristics and function. The device has been designed to compiy
with the applicable sections of ANSI/AAMI American National Standard for Electrosurgical Devices
HF-18, the International Electrotechnical Commission Standard for Electrosurgical Devices, IEC
60601-1, 60601-1-1, 60601-1-2, 60601-1-4, 60601-1-6, 60601-1-8, 60601-2-2, Underwriter’s
Laboratory UL60601-1, Risk Management ISO 14971 and Biocompatibility ISO 10993.
Software for the System 2450 ESU will be validated in accordance with internal ConMed
Electrosurgery procedures including the FDA guidance “General Principles of Software Validation’.
The level of concern for the ConMed System 2450 is “Moderate” as defined in the FDA guidance for
the Content of Premarket Submissions for Software Contained in Medical Devices. This is based on
the following considerations:

e The System 2450 software will be validated and verified according to documented
procedures, which include, but are not limited to System Level Hazard Analysis, peer review
of software design and software module testing. All validation and verification activities will
be completed prior to commercial distribution;

e Output characteristics are equivalent to the values for other previously cleared
electrosurgical generators;

e The operator controls the use of the device;

e The device provides alarms for conditions that could pose a risk to the patient;

e The operator sets the appropriate mode and output settings for the device.

Regulation Number: 21 CFR 878.4400
Regulation Name: Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation device and accessories
Regulatory Class: II
Product Code: GEI
Dated: July 21, 2005
Received: July 25, 2005
Dear Ms. Vetter:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class I] (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2- Ms. Pamela Vetter
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled.
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
