2. Names
Device Name: Omnilux New-U
Classification Name: Laser Instrument, Surgical Powered - General and Plastic
Surgery - Class II, 79-GEX
Although this device is not a laser and is intended for OTC use, the manufacturer thinks
this is the closest applicable classification name.

combination (K050216).

4. Device Description . .
The Omnilux New-U is a source of high spectral purity. It provides uniform or “hot-spot”
free illumination. The outputs are pre-tuned to a particular wavelength with a narrow
spectral bandwidth. The red output of the Omnilux New-U is 633 + 6 nm, and the IR
output is 830 + 5 nm. The Omnilux New-U device itself contains a selector switch
(red/off/IR), the LED array assembly, and arrangements for air cooling. A separate,
universal, power supply converts mains AC power to the DC power required by the
Omnilux New-U. Treatment time is controlled by the operator.

5. Indications for Use
The Omnilux New-U is intended to emit energy in the red and IR region of the spectrum,
specifically indicated to reduce periorbital wrinkles. The target patient population for the
Omnilux New-U is the same as that for the predicate devices, however the Omnilux
New-U is designed for home use.

6. Performance Data
Based upon an analysis of the overall performance characteristics for the device, Photo
Therapeutics Limited believes that no significant differences exist between the
previously approved Omnilux revive (K030426), Omnilux plus (K043317), Omnilux
revive/Omnilux plus combination (K050216) and the Omnilux New-U. Therefore, the
Omnilux New-U raises no new issues of safety or effectiveness.

Dear Ms. Darcy:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Piease be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
