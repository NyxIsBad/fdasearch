Trade Name: Waterlase®
Common Name: Er,Cr:YSGG laser and Hydrokinetic System
Classification Name: Surgical laser instrument
Classification Code: 79 GEX, MXF, DZI
Equivalent Devices:
BioLase Technology, Inc. Waterlase®
Device Description:
The Waterlase® hydrokinetic dental laser system is a diverse device utilized to
perform a variety of dental applications. For hard tissue procedures the
Waterlase® uses the Erbium, Chromium: Yttrium, Scandium, Gallium Gamet
(Er,Cr:¥SGG) laser in combination with advanced water atomization technology
to cut, remove, roughen and etch tissues. Soft tissue procedures are performed
using a different mode of operation where direct Er,Cr:YSGG laser energy is
applied to incise, excise or ablate these tissues. In soft tissue procedures the water
spray is applied for hydration, cooling or to keep tissues clean. For hard tissue
applications the spray is part of the tissue removing process as well as hydration,
cooling and keeping the tissues clean.
4 flexible fiberoptic handpiece delivers the Waterlase® laser energy. A visible
light emitted from the handpiece distal end pinpoints the area of treatment. In both
hard and soft tissue applications the power output, pulse energy, repetition rate
and air and water flow rates are adjustable to specific user requirements.

Cautions, Precautions and Contraindications:
All clinical procedures performed with Waterlase® must be subjected to the same
clinical judgment and care as with traditional techniques. Patient risk must always
be considered and fully understood before clinical treatment. The clinician must
completely understand the patient's medical history prior to treatment. Exercise
caution for general medical conditions that might contraindicate a local procedure.
Such conditions may include allergy to local or topical anesthetics, heart disease,
lung disease, bleeding disorders, sleep apnea or an immune system deficiency.
Medical clearance from patient's physician is advisable when doubt exists
regarding treatment.
Substantial Equivalence:
Waterlase® is substantially equivalent, in terms of safety and efficacy, to
previously cleared devices.

Dear Ms. Rizoiu:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibiticns against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class Il (Special Controls) or class IIT (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
