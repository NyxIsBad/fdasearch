Proprietary Name: Ion Medical Bipolar Coagulation Pen
Common Name: Electrosurgical handpiece
Classification Name: Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation device and accessories
(21 CFR 878.4400, Product Code GEI)
Device Description:
The Ion Medical Bipolar Coagulation Pen is a handheld electrosurgical device which conducts
low power radiofrequency current to target tissue for the purpose of coagulation. The device is
comprised of an ABS plastic handle with a stainless steel coaxial probe tip and a 2-pin style
connector at the proximal end for connection with compatible bipolar radiofrequency coagulation
generators and cables.
Intended Use:
The Ion Medical Bipolar Coagulation Pen is a single use instrument intended to coagulate tissue
using radiofrequency electric current during general and ophthalmic surgical procedures where
wet field conditions exist.
Substantial Equivalence:
The Ion Medical Bipolar Coagulation Pen is substantially equivalent in technology and intended
use to the currently marketed Kirwan Bipolar Pencil Coagulator (K962678) and Mentor WetField Hemostatic Eraser Bipolar Instrument (K911160) in that the device conducts low power
radiofrequency current, supplied by a bipolar coagulation electrosurgical generator, to a coaxial
probe tip to perform tissue coagulation to control bleeding.
Safety and Effectiveness:
Device electrical safety has been demonstrated through compliance with applicable requirements
of ANSI/AAMI HF 18 and IEC 60601-2-2 for dielectric integrity. Biocompatibility of all patient
contact materials is demonstrated through evaluation and testing in accordance with the
requirements of ISO 10993-1. The device is supplied sterile and will comply with a sterility
assurance level of 10°. No new issues of safety or effectiveness are a result of this device.

Dear Mr. Huron:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and

. adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

Page 2 — Mr. Keith Huron
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance
