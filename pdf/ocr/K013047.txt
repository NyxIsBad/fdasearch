IL Description
The family of Fotona Dualis systems is based on the Nd:YAG laser technology. Within the
systems, an optical cavity contains the Nd:YAG crystal, which is activated by means of
the use of flashlamps. After the cavity, a red diode aiming beam is reflected onto a coaxial
beam path using a beamsplitter assembly. The combined therapeutic and aiming beams are
guided down an optical fiber delivery system to a focusing handpiece. The laser is used in
non-contact mode.
IL. Intended Use
The family of Fotona DUALIS Nd:YAG laser systems is indicated for use in surgical and
aesthetic applications requiring selective photothermolysis of target chromophores
in soft tissue in general and plastic surgery and dermatology. In addition, the family is
indicated to effect stable long-term, or permanent hair reduction in Fitzpatrick skin types
I - VI through selective targeting of melanin in hair follicles (where permanent hair .
reduction is defined as a long-term stable reduction in number of hairs regrowing after a
treatment regimen). .
IIL Summary of Substantial Equivalence
The family of Fotona DUALIS lasers shares the same general indications for use, and
therefore is substantially equivalent to the currently marketed Laserscope Lyra (K010834)
and to Altus Medical Aesthetic Nd:YAG Laser (K003202).

Technologically, the predicate devices have similar characteristics to the DUALIS lasers.

All systems comprising a flashlamp pumped Nd:YAG laser rod generating light at a

wavelength of 1064 nm, which is subsequently delivered to the patient via an optical fiber

delivery system and focusing handpiece.

All lasers utilize class I aiming beams which pose no hazard to the user.

All systems are microprocessor controlled devices. The microprocessor control regulates

normal operation, permits parameter selection and avoids hazard incidence.

All systems utilize an internal closed loop water-air heat exchanger circuit for optimal

thermal control of the laser cavity.

The risk and benefits for the DUALIS family are comparable to the predicate devices

when used for similar clinical applications.

It is therefore believed that there are no new questions of Safety or Effectiveness raised by

the introduction of the DUALIS family.

Dear Ms. Valjavec:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and we have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the
indications for use stated in the enclosure) to devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to
May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have
been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
(Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices,
good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements conceming your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CER Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820), and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 — Ms. Mojea Valjavec :
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device'as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801 and
additionally 21 CFR Part 809.10 for in vitro diagnostic devices), please contact the Office of
Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Additionally, for questions on the promotion and advertising of
your device, please contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4639. Also, please note the
regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97).
