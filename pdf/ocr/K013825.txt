Device Trade Name: Smoothbeam Laser System
Device Common Name: Dermatology Laser
Classification: Class II (21 CFR § 878.4810 Laser Surgical Instrument for use in General
and Plastic Surgery and in Dermatology)
Predicate Devices: Laser Aesthetics CoolTouch (K003715) and Candela 1450 nm Diode laser
(K002421)
Description of the Smoothbeam Laser System: The Diode laser is a Continuous Wave, diode medical laser,
controlled by an embedded processor, for use in dermatology for the treatment of periorbital wrinkles. The
Candela Smoothbeam Laser System is comprised of a power supply, optical delivery system, software control
system and Dynamic Cooling Device. The laser output energy is delivered via an optical fiber to a handpiece,
which produces circular beams on the skin. The Dynamic Cooling Device provides a short burst of cryogen
spray during the laser treatment. The cryogen is delivered via a hose to a nozzle located in the handpiece. The
Dynamic Cooling Device functions to cool the skin during the laser treatment minimizing thermal damage to
skin during laser treatment and reducing pain associated with laser treatment. The Candela Smoothbeam
Laser System is equipped with safety interlock systems to protect patients and operators. Users of the device,
make selections from a control panel to regulate operation during the laser treatment.
Intended use of Smoothbeam Laser System: The Smoothbeam Laser System is indicated for the treatment
of periorbital wrinkles.
Performance Standards: As a laser product, the Smoothbeam Laser System is required to conform and does
conform to the Laser Performance Standard (21 CFR 1040). In addition, the device will conform to the UL
2601 Electrical Safety Standard and with the Harmonized Standard EN 60601-1-2, Part 2 established by the
European Community.
Clinical Performance Data: Clinical trials produced results that indicate that the Smoothbeam Laser System
is effective in the treatment of periorbital wrinkles.
Summary of Substantial Equivalence: The Candela Smoothbeam Laser System has the same intended use,
utilizes similar operating principles and matches key design aspects, including spot size, similar wavelength .
and/or the same maximum delivered power as the predicate device. On the basis of similarities in methods of
assembly, method of operation, and intended uses, Candela believes that its Smoothbeam Laser System is
substantially equivalent to the predicate device.

Dear Ms. Nelson:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean

or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
