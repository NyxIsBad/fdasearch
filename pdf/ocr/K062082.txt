Predicate Device: Valleylab Force Argon™ II Argon Enhanced Electrosurgical System
K964636, cleared March 11, 1997
Device Description: The ABC Dissecting Electrodes are electrodes used in conjunction with an
Argon Beam Coagulation generator. The system is designed to provide a controlled flow of argon
to electrosurgical handsets. The handsets allow the clinicians to perform argon enhanced
Electrosurgery in open and laproscopic procedures. The electrodes attach to several previously
cleared ConMed Electrosurgery ABC® hand pieces to convert from Argon Beam Coagulation only
to Argon Beam Dissect.
When cutting, the edge of the electrode shall be in contact with the tissue while being enclosed in
an envelope of argon gas. The electrosurgical energy is passed through the electrode as it is
drawn across the tissue. When coagulating, the accessory electrode is not in contact with the
tissue and is separated from the tissue by distance for fulguration to achieve the desired result.
The electrodes utilizes previously cleared/marketed generators and hand pieces.
Argon Beam Coagulation (ABC)
Argon Beam Coagulation was developed to satisfy a need for a more even spray coagulation
effect. With normal electrosurgery spray coagulation may over coagulate and carbonize some
areas and under coagulate others due to the randomness of the arcing process. With ABC
technology the RF current is focused in a directional, non-contacting, room temperature beam of
argon gas. The RF current follows the argon beam from the ABC unit to the patient's tissue and
forms a reticulum of arc tunnels which are smaller, more numerous, more uniform size and depth,
and more evenly distributed on the tissue. The advantages are faster hemostasis, more
homogenous eschar, less tissue damage, and enhanced healing ability. The flow of argon gas
also serves to clear the surgical site of fluids allowing direct coagulation on the stroma of the target
tissue and reduces carbonization of the tissue to prevent floating eschar.
The sterile disposable electrodes allow the clinician the capability of using their existing hand
pieces while being able to exchange the electrodes based on the clinician's desire and need —
clinical coagulation or cutting.
Intended Use of Device: Sterile, singe-use electrosurgical accessory used in conjunction with
Argon Beam Coagulation generator for delivery of argon gas and electrosurgical current to achieve
cutting and coagulation of tissue.

Technological Characteristics: The proposed device is equivalent to the identified predicate device
with respect to technological characteristics and function. The device has been designed to comply
with the applicable sections of ANSI/AAMI American National Standard for Electrosurgical Devices
HF-18, the international Electrotechnical Commission Standard for Electrosurgical Devices, 60601 2-2, Risk Management ISO 14971 and Biocompatibility SO 10993.

e There are no changes to the generator and therefore no changes to the accompanying

software.

Regulation Number: 21 CFR 878.4400
Regulation Name: Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation device and accessories
Regulatory Class: Class II
Product Code: BEI
Dated: November 27, 2006
Received: November 29, 2006
Dear Mr. Riedel:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class I] (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 — Mr. Shawn Riedel
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section $10(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115 Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
(240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/industry/support/index.html.
