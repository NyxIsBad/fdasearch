Description of the Helios I[® Q- The Helios II® laser system is based on the Nd:YAG
Switched Nd:YAG Laser System: (1064 nm) and frequency doubled KTP Nd:YAG
(532 nm) laser technology. Three basic elements of
operations are as follows:
1) ANd:YAG crystal is used as a gain medium :
which produces a laser beam.
2) A resonator then amplifies the beam.
: 3) A lamp that contains Xe gas is used, as a
pumping light source. The lamp requires a
high-pressure power source device for
operation. When the electric energy
generated from the high-pressure power
source is induced into the electrode of the
lamp, it converts into light energy. This
converted light energy pumps the Nd:YAG
crystal — a gain medium — and the light
exhausted from the crystal is amplified into a
specific wavelength light. As it passes
between the resonant gases, laser beam
radiates to an output unit.
The regulation of laser output and repetition rate can
be set by the user via GUI (Graphic User Interface)
and controlled by microprocessor, which interfaces
with the power supply.

Dear Mr. Choi:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to niarket the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean .
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); medical device reporting (reporting of medical
. device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
: product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
