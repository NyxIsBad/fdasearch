Predicate Devices: This is a Special 510(k) for the Aurora SR that was cleared
under K031993.

Device Description: The Aurora SR is a device that is used for superficial benign
vascular and pigmented lesion treatment. The Aurora SR
treatment is based on a principle of selective thermolysis.
According to this principle, parameters of optical and RF
energy (spectrum, exposure duration and energy density) are
chosen (and optimized) to selectively damage (destroy)
vascular and pigmented lesions without damaging the
surrounding tissues.

The Aurora SR is intended for use in dermatology for superficial benign vascular and

pigmented lesion treatment. /

The modifications to the Aurora SR do not affect the intended use or alter the

fundamental scientific technology of the device. The only device modification is

changing the light spectrum output. There are no labeling changes that affect the
intended use of the device. The device modifications raise no new issues of safety or
effectiveness.
