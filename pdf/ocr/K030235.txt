Trade Name: F1 Diode Laser System
Common Name: Pulsed Diode Laser
Classification: Laser Instrument, Surgical, Powered: GEX
Description: The F1 Diode Laser System delivers a pulsed infrared laser light at a wavelength
of 810 nanometers. The laser consists of several interconnected sections: The cabinet which
houses the laser diode, the power supply, the PC-104, and the microcontroller, the umbilical
which houses the fiber optics delivery system, and the handpiece and the external TE chiller.
Intended Use: The Device is indicated for hair removal and permanent hair reduction in
dermatology and plastic surgery procedures.
Predicate Devices: The predicate devices referenced in this submission are: the Opus Medical
F1 Diode Laser System for the existing indication, the Lumenis LightSheer™ Pulsed Diode
Array Laser System, Iridex Iriderm Apex 800, and the Altus Medical Modified CoolGlide
Aesthetic Lasers.
Summary and Conclusions Regarding Substantial Equivalence:
By definition, a device is substantially equivalent when the device has the same intended use and the
same technological characteristics as the predicate device, or has the same intended use and different
technological characteristics, but it can be demonstrated that the device is as safe and effective as the
predicate device and the new device does not raise different questions regarding safety and
effectiveness as compared to the predicate device.
The differences between theF1 Diode Laser System and the predicate devices cited do not raise any
different questions regarding safety and effectiveness. The differences in the technological
characteristics are minimal. Furthermore, the subject of this submission is identical to the previously
cleared F1 Diode Laser System with the exception of the indications for use. The new indications
are nearly identical to the indications of two of the predicate devices.
The device, as designed, is as safe and effective as the predicate devices, and the device is
substantially equivalent to the referenced predicate devices.

Dear Ms. van de Zande:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device

devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class IJ] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may

that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CEFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation contro] provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
