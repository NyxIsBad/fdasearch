Device and Technology Description: oo
The Pajunk MIS-System contains but is not limited to electrode-inserts for comfortable and safe
coagulation. PAJUNK has extended its range of instruments for MIS by a reuseable, modular
system with disposeable inserts, which permits the economic replacement of the sensitive
inserts.
The instrument inserts consist of four basic types: Grasping Forceps, Scissors, Biopsy Punches
and Clamps /Needle Holders. All handles can be combined with all insulated shafts and
instrument inserts, regardless of their size and shape.
The shaft screws onto the handle tightly, and it ensures the safe and secure connection of the
two elements. Every module of the handle-instrument is kept in place in its bracing future,
secured against distortion. A snap-on mechanism locks the instrument insert in the shaft: This
whole element can then in turn be latched onto the handle by a special locking device. This
latching of the connecting rod and the shaft minimizes the torsion stress exerted upon the /
instrument insert; the double security against distortion transfers the torque also to the entire
shaft.
For the 1293- and 1292- Combination Handle an ergonomically placed switch allows the ratchet
to be easily switched on or off during usage. Jacketed with glass fiber-reinforced plastic, the
precise mechanical construction of the PAJUNK handle ensures maximum stability. Designed
for left and right handed use, the ergonomically shaped handles are simple and comfortable to
operate. The rotary wheel can be adjusted with a little pressure applied by the index finger. A
built-in rotation stop secures the desired position when grasping.
And with that, PAJUNK® has created the option to always work and also to coagulate with new,
guaranteed sharp scissors at every intervention. Three different sizes are available: micro,
medium and large. They are packed individually, sterile, and they can be replaced very easily.
The fast and easy assembly is based on the ingenious locking mechanism. The scissor-insert is
clicked into the connecting rod and tightly screwed together with the guidance tube. Please
observe, that the replacement can only be carried out if the scissors are closed. Biocompatibility
information for Pajunk’s adaptable disposable inserts is located in Section 15.0 of this
submission.
Intended Use
Pajunks disposable inserts are instruments insulated for optional monopolar coagulation which
enable a surgeon to grasp, manipulate, dissect, retrieve, biopsy, cut or coagulate internal tissue
or organs while performing laparoscopic procedures.

Substantial Equivalence “fe 3
Based on the information within this submission, it is our conclusion that Pajunk’s reusable
inserts marketed under 510(k) number K033249, and disposable inserts (subject device) are
substantially equivalent.
Pajunk’s electrodes are as safe and effective as the predicate devices when used by
professional surgeons in accordance with the instructions for use supplied with these medical
devices.
Conclusion:
The comparison between the predicate device and the proposed device demonstrates that the
proposed Pajunk devices are at least as safe and effective as, as well as substantially equivalent
ta Pajunks predicate device.

Dear Christian Quass:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for
use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce
prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good
manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class If (Special Controls) or class IIT (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be
found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish
further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or
any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with
all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807);
labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality
systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820): and if applicable, the electronic product radiation
control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
