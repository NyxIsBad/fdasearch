Dornier Diode Laser Family K o 2 D 22 q
In response to the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990, the following is a summary of the
safety and effectiveness information upon which the substantial equivalence determination
is based.
The safety and effectiveness of the Dornier Diode Lasers is based upon a determination
of the substantial equivalence as well as the safety and effectiveness of its predicate
device which includes the following: Diomed 810 nm Surgical Lasers as well as the
Dornier diode lasers themselves, Dornier Medilas D Laser System (K982629), Dornier
Medilas D SkinPulse Laser System (K000072) and Dornier Medilas D SkinPulse S Laser
System (K003993).

Intended Use
Dornier MedTech America, Inc. is requesting the expansion of the indications for
use for the Dornier Diode Laser family previously cleared under K982629,
K000072, K003993 and K021724. The Dornier Diode Laser family, Medilas™ D
Fibertom Laser (“Medilas D”’), Medilas™ D SkinPulse™ (‘SkinPulse’) and
Medilas™ D SkinPulse™ S ("SkinPulse S"), are intended for use in the treatment
of symptoms due to urinary outflow obstruction secondary to benign prostatic
hyperplasia (BPH) in men over the age of 50 with prostates with median and/or
lateral lobes ranging in total volume from 28-85cc and for cutting, vaporization,
ablation, and coagulation of soft tissue in conjunction with endoscopic equipment
(including laparoscopes, hysteroscopes, bronchoscopes, gastroscopes,
cystoscopes, and colonoscopes), or in incision/excision, vaporization, ablation and
coagulation of soft tissue in contact or non-contact open surgery (with or without a
handpiece). The SkinPulse™ and SkinPulse™ S lasers are also for use for the
treatment and/or removal of vascular lesions (tumors) and for the removal of
unwanted hair.
The Dornier Diode Family Lasers are indicated for use in medicine and surgery, in
the following medical specialties: Urology, Plastic Surgery, General Surgery,
Dermatology, Gynecology, Pulmonary Surgery, Gastroenterology, ENT and
Radiology.
This premarket notification requests clearance for the additional indication as
stated:
The Dornier diode family lasers, Medilas D Fibertom Laser (“Medilas D”),
Medilas D SkinPulse (“SkinPulse”) and Medilas D SkinPulse S ("SkinPulse
S") are intended for use in endovascular coagulation of the greater
saphenous vein of the thigh in patients with superficial vein reflux.

Technological Characteristics and Substantial Equivalence
From a clinical perspective and comparing design specifications, the Dornier diode
lasers and the predicate device, Diomed 810 nm Surgical Lasers are substantially
equivalent. Based on the technological characteristics and overall performance of
the devices, Dornier MedTech America, Inc. believes that no significant differences
exist between the Dornier diode lasers and the predicate device.
Dornier believes the minor differences of the Dornier diode family lasers and its
predicate laser devices should not raise any concerns regarding the overall safety
or effectiveness.

Dear Mr. Thomas:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
