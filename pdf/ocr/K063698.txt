Substantial equivalence claimed to:
K 875338: CHRYS (20 Watt COz Laser, cleared on April 13, 1988. The CHRYS (20
Watt CO. Laser was cleared as a laser surgical instrument for use in general surgery as
well as plastic surgery and in dermatology.
Device Description
The CO2 Laser System, Model C-LAS is an easily transported table top laser console
made of mainly machined aluminum and optics for the transmission of reflection of CO,
laser wave lengths. It is a carbon dioxide laser which emits laser light at 10.6
micrometers and has a RF excited laser tube which produces an output power of about 30
watts. The laser is for used by physicians for cutting and coagulation at a wound during
surgery. The physician uses the laser light on tissue via lenses and a focusing hand piece,
or via a diamond scalpel which transmits the laser light onto the scalpel.

You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
