Device Names
Trade Name: Laser Diffusing Fiber (LDF)
Cooling Catheter System (CCS)
Bare Tip Fiber (BTF)
Proprietary Name: Visualase Cooled Laser Application System (VCLAS)
Common Name: __ Diffusing laser fiber or probe
Cooling catheter or sheath
Bare tip laser fiber or probe
Classification: Accessory to powered surgical laser instrument
Predicate Device
SLT Diffuser™ Fiber (KO10041)
Indigo Bare-Tip™ Fiberoptic (K963081)
Description of Device
The VCLAS family consists of three components, the LDF, CCS, and BTF. The
LDF and BTF transmit laser energy to the tissue situated at their distal regions.
The LDF is comprised of a standard silica fiber optic cable affixed with a diffusing
tip assembly. The diffusing tip assembly is comprised of a plastic tube that is
filled with a transparent matrix in which light dispersing particles are embedded.
The distal end of the tube is sealed with a higher concentration of scattering
K053087 Response Letter Page 7 of 60

particles in a conical structure to prevent significant forward transmission of
energy.

The LDF may be used with a cooling catheter, in particular the compatible CCS,
but such a catheter is not required. The CCS can be employed with or without
coolant flow. The use of coolant provides cooling for the surfaces of the CCS in
contact with both the tissue and the LDF.

The BTF is comprised of a standard silica fiber optic cable identical to fiber optic
used in the LDF. The distal end of the BTF is terminated in a flat, polished face
and is designed for use in both contact and non-contact applications.

Indications for Use

The LDF and CCS are indicated for use to necrotize or coagulate soft tissue
through interstitial irradiation or thermal therapy in medicine and surgery in
cardiovascular thoracic surgery (excluding the heart and the vessels in the
pericardial sac), dermatology, ear-nose-throat surgery, gastroenterology, general
surgery, gynecology, head and neck surgery, neurosurgery, plastic surgery,
pulmonology, radiology, and urology, for wavelengths 800nm through 1064nm.
The Bare Tip Fiber (BTF) is intended for use in vaporization, cutting, ablation and
coagulation of soft tissues with or without scopes or handpieces, for contact or
non-contact surgery in medicine and surgery in cardiovascular thoracic surgery
(excluding the heart and the vessels of the pericardial sac), dermatology, earnose-throat surgery, gastroenterology, general surgery, gynecology, head and
neck surgery, neurosurgery, plastic surgery, pulmonology, radiology and urology
for the wavelength range of 800nm through 1064nm.

Comparison to Predicate Device

The Laser Diffusing Fiber (LDF) and Cooling Catheter System (CCS) have been
shown to be substantially equivalent to the SLT Diffuser™ fiber (KO10041). The
Bare Tip Fiber (BTF) has been shown to be substantially equivalent to the bare
tip fiber marketed with the Indigo Diffuser Fiberoptic (K963081). Differences
were determined to be minor and are each within the specifications listed by the
predicate devices and does not raise any concerns regarding the overall safety
and effectiveness of the device.

Non-clinical Performance Tests:

Engineering studies have demonstrated the substantial equivalence of the Laser
Diffusing Fiber (LDF) to the SLT Diffuser Fiber Delivery Systems (K 010041).
The studies concluded that the treated tissue displayed an ellipsoidal coagulation
area surrounding the diffusing region of the laser diffusing fiber. In all instances,

K053087 Response Letter Page 8 of 60

the fiber and lasers functioned as intended and performed in a manner similar to

the predicate device when used in accordance with the labeled directions for use

and specified indications.

The materials used in the Visualase Laser Diffusing Fiber (LDF), Cooling

Catheter System (CCS), and Bare Tip Fiber (BTF) were determined to be

biocompatible according to appropriate international test standards.

Conclusion

BioTex has demonstrated the Visualase Laser Diffusing Fiber (LDF), Cooling

Catheter System (CCS), and Bare Tip Fiber (BTF) are substantially equivalent to

the predicate devices based on design, test results, and indications for use.

Dear Dr. Gowda:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments. or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
Lf your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class IIl (PMA).
it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device
can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA
may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Revister.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your
. device to proceed to the market.

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801). please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
