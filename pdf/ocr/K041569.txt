Intended Use
The Clearl100™ Phototherapy System (“ Clear100™ ”) is intended to
provide phototherapeutic light to the body. The Clear100 ™ is
indicated to emit visible blue/violet light to treat moderate
inflammatory acne vulgaris and infrared light energy for the
temporary increase in local blood circulation, temporary relief of minor
muscle and joint aches, pains and stiffness and relaxation of muscles;
for muscle spasms, minor pain and stiffness associated with arthritis.
Technological Characteristics
The Clear100™ Therapy System is a high intensity lamp emitting visible
light in the violet-blue range (405 nm to 420 nm) and in the near infrared
range (850-890nm) with a fluency of light ranging between 50-200 mW/cm?.
The system includes a spectral band light source with spectral emittance
concentrated in the violet/blue spectral band and near infrared range with
an optical system for controlling spectra and beam parameters of the light
source. It also includes a mechanical fixture for holding the light source at an
adjustable distance and direction related to the skin treatment area, and a
timer unit to indicate the duration of light treatment.
Substantial Equivalence
The Clear100™ has the same intended use and indications for use and very
similar technological characteristics as the CureLight ReClear. The minor
technological differences between these devices, t.e., the number of lamps
they contain and the type of timer, do not raise any new questions of safety or
effectiveness. Thus, Clear100™ is substantially equivalent to its predicate
device.

Dear Mr. Kahan:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing 21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market. . /
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
