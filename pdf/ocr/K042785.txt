Delivery Devices
The fundamental technical characteristics and device specifications of the Nidek
Multi Color Laser Photocoagulator Model MC-300 are the same as those of the
predicate devices. The Model MC-300 and the predicate devices are all Diode Laser
Pumped Solid State Lasers (DPSSL). The Model MC-300 and the predicate device
use a variety of delivery systems, including slit lamps, to deliver the laser beam. The
Model MC-300 and the predicate devices are indicated for use in surgical treatment of
ocular pathology, including retinal photocoagulation, panretinal photocoagulation,
intravitreal endophotocoagulation, iridotomy, iridectomy and trabeculoplasty.
4, DEVICE DESCRIPTION
The Nidek Multi Color Laser Photocoagulator Model MC-300 is a diode pumped
solid state laser (DPSSL) ophthalmic photocoagulation system that produces three
treatment beams: a 532 nm (green) wavelength, a 561 (yellow) wavelength, and a 659
(red) wavelength. The Model MC-300 uses the same wavelength for the aiming beam
as the treatment beams, so that the operator can recognize the selected wavelength by
the color of the aiming spot. The Model MC-300 splits the pumped laser beam into
the aiming and treatment beams so that they can both be controlled separately. The
multi-color laser beam is aligned with the respective aiming laser beam in the optical
system inside the unit and gathers them in a fiber optic cable. The laser beam is led to
the delivery unit via the fiber-optic cable, shaped into the specified spot size in the

optical system, and emitted to the affected area (the emission areas of both the
therapeutic laser beam and the aiming beam are the same).
The Model MC-300 can be used to coagulate the target tissue efficiently and safely,
and the system can be applied to transpupillary photocoagulation procedures using a
, slit-lamp.

A protective filter may be attached to each delivery unit in the observation optical
path so that the operator’s eye can be protected from the laser beam if it is reflected
from a patient’s eye or contact lens during laser emission. The Model MC-300 uses
the following delivery units for use in a variety of ophthalmic procedures:
e NIDEK Slit-Lamp Delivery Unit
e ZEISS Slit-Lamp Attachable Delivery Unit
e Binocular Indirect Ophthalmoscope Delivery Unit (Keeler All Pupil II Type)

5. INTENDED USE
The Nidek Multi Color Laser Photocoagulator Model MC-300 is indicated to be used
in ophthalmic surgical procedures, including retinal and macular photocoagulation,
iridotomy and trabeculoplasty

6. TECHNOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS
A comparison of the technological characteristics of the Nidek Multi Color Laser
Photocoagulator Model MC-300 and the predicate devices has been performed, and
the results of this comparison demonstrate that the Nidek Multi Color Laser
Photocoagulator Model MC-300 has the same basic technological characteristics as
the predicate devices and is equivalent to the marketed predicate devices. The

differences between the Nidek Multi Color Laser Photocoagulator Model MC-300
and the predicate devices are insignificant and do not affect the safety or effectiveness
of the device.
7. PERFORMANCE DATA
The Nidek Multi Color Laser Photocoagulator Model MC-300 has been designed and
will be tested in accordance with applicable safety standards. System and component
testing was completed based on product specifications and hazard effects determined
from the risk analysis.
8. CONCLUSIONS
Nidek Incorporated has demonstrated through its evaluation of the Nidek Multi Color
Laser Photocoagulator Model MC-300 that the device is equivalent to the predicate
device with respect to intended use, technological characteristics, and safety and
effectiveness.

Description of Laser: The Nidek Multi Color Laser Photocoagulator Model MC-300 is an ophthalmic
photocoagulation system that uses a diode pumped solid state laser beam with wavelengths of 532 nm
(green), 561 nm (yellow) and 659 nm (red) for therapeutic treatment as well as the aiming beams. The
system can be used in ophthalmic surgical procedures such as retinal and macular photocoagulation,
iridotomy and Jaser trabeculoplasty. The system can be applied to transpupillary photocoagulation
procedures using two types of slit-lamp delivery units. The Binocular Indirect Ophthalmoscope (B.1.0.)
Delivery Unit allows the physician to perform laser photocoagulation while observing the fundus with the
indirect ophthalmoscope.

Dear Ms. Patterson:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
