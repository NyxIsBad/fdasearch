Name of the Device: Aurora DS , DS Applicator
Predicate Devices: This is a Special 510(k) for the Aurora DS that was cleared
under K041969.
Device Description: The Aurora DS is a device that is used for the removal of
unwanted hair from skin types I-VI, and to effect stable long-term, or permanent, hair
reduction. The Aurora DS treatment is based on a principle of selective thermolysis.
According to this principle, parameters of optical and RF energy (spectrum, exposure
duration and energy density) are chosen (and optimized) to selectively damage
(destroy) vascular and pigmented lesions without damaging the surrounding tissues.
The Aurora DS is intended for use in dermatology for the removal of unwanted hair
from skin types I-VI, and to effect stable long-term, or permanent, hair reduction.
The modifications to the Aurora DS do not affect the intended use or alter the
fundamental scientific technology of the device. The only device modification is
changing the light spectrum output. There are no labeling changes that affect the
intended use of the device. The device modifications raise no new issues of safety or
effectiveness.
