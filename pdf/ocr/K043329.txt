The Omnilux Revive and Blue is a combination of two sources of high spectral
purity. They provide uniform or “hot-spot” free illumination. The two output are
pre-tuned to one wavelength with a narrow spectral bandwidth. The output
wavelength of Omnilux Revive is 633 + 5 nm, and Omnilux Blue is 415 + 5nm.
The Omnilux base unit contains the power supplies and the control unit. Attached
to the base unit are three folding arms. The LED head can be attached to the end
of the arms and then positioned for patient treatment. The control unit consists of
an LCD and keyboard together with the control electronics. The user interface
software allows the operator to access and control all device functions.
5. Indications for Use
The Omnilux Revive and Blue Combination is intended to emit energy in the red
and blue region of the spectrum to treat dermatological conditions, specifically
indicated to treat mild to moderate acne vulgaris.
6. Performance Data
Based upon an analysis of the overall performance characteristics for the device,
Photo Therapeutics Limited believes that no significant differences exist between
the ‘Omnilux Revive and Blue Combination’ and the previously approved
Omnilux Revive (K030426) and Omnilux Blue (K030883) devices and their
respective predicates. Therefore, the Omnilux Revive and Blue Combination
raises no new issues of safety or effectiveness.
