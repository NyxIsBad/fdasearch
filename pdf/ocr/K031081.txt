Common/Usual Name: Electrosurgical Instruments
Classification Name: Electrosurgical Cutting and Coagulation Device

And Accessories (21 CFR 878.4400)
Proprietary Name: Everest LP Bipolar Scissors and Gyrus LP

Bipolar Scissors
The device is a Class I! medical device. The Everest LP Bipolar Scissors and Gyrus LP
Bipolar Scissors are a modification to the predicate device cleared under K904993. The
Bipolar LP Scissors are identical in construction (with the exception of shaft length) and in
component materials when compared to the predicate device. The scissors blades are
electrically isolated from each other enabling one blade to act as a retum electrode,
eliminating the need for a return pad. The modification has not altered the fundamental
technology of the predicate device cleared under K904993. The intended use, electrosurgical
coagulation and mechanical cutting during surgical procedures is similar to the predicate
device cleared under K904993. The energy source, Bipolar Electrosurgical Energy, is the
same energy type as used for the predicate devices .
In conclusion, as the design, materials of construction, function and intended use of the
Modified LP Bipolar Scissors is similar to that of the predicate devices currently cleared,
Gyrus Medical Inc. believes that no new issues of safety and effectiveness are raised and that
the submitted device is substantially equivalent.

You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The ,
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
