14 510(k) Summary

e In the creation of a corneal flap in patients undergoing LASIK surgery or other treatment
requiring initial lamellar resection of the cornea;

e Inpatients undergoing surgery or other treatment requiring initial lamellar resection of the
cornea;

e In patients undergoing surgery or other treatment requiring initial lamellar resection of the
cornea to create tunnels for placement of corneal ring segments;

e In lamellar keratoplasty and corneal harvesting;

e In the creation of a lamellar cut/resection of the comea for lamellar keratoplasty and in the
creation of a penetrating cut/incision for penetrating keratoplasty.

Comeal dissection with the iFS Laser is achieved through precise individual micro
photodisruptions of tissue, created by tightly focused ultrashort optical which are delivered

through a disposable applanation lens assembly while fixating the eye under low vacuum.

STATEMENT OF INTENDED USE:

The iFS Laser System is an ophthalmic surgical laser indicated for use:

e In the creation of a corneal flap in patients undergoing LASIK surgery or other treatment
requiring initial lamellar resection of the cornea;

e In patients undergoing surgery or other treatment requiring initial lamellar resection of the
cornea;

e In patients undergoing surgery or other treatment requiring initial lamellar resection of the
cornea to create tunnels for placement of corneal ring segments;

e In lamellar keratoplasty and corneal harvesting;

e In the creation of a lamellar cut/resection of the cornea for lamellar keratoplasty and in the
creation of a penetrating cut/incision for penetrating keratoplasty.

STATEMENT OF HOW THE TECHNOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DEVICE COMPARE TO

THOSE OF THE PREDICATE OR LEGALLY MARKETED DEVICE:

The technological characteristics of the iFS Laser are substantially equivalent to those cleared

under K060372, K063682, and K032910 for corneal resections and incisions.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF NONCLINICAL TESTS AND RESULTS:

The iFS Laser System has undergone testing and is in compliance with applicable safety

standards. The iFS Laser and the accessory IntraLase Patient Interface were found to perform

equivalently to the predicate laser and patient interface for the creation of corneal resections.

Thus, the iFS Laser System and the predicate device have similar safety, effectiveness and

performance profiles.

Dear Ms. Weiner:
This letter corrects our substantially equivalent letter of April 25, 2008.
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices,
good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be
found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); medical device reporting (reporting of medical
device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
go to http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersO ffices/CDRH/CDRHOffices/ucm115809.htm for
the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance. Also, please
note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part
807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21
CFR Part 803), please go to
http://www. fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ReportaProblem/default.htm for the CDRH’s Office
of Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance.
You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the
Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number
