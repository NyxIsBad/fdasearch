Dear Ms. Jones:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) notification of intent to market the device referenced
above and we have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for
use stated in the enclosure) to devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to
May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act (Act). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls
provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for
annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and
prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III
(Premarket Approval), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major
regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21,
Parts 800 to 895. A substantially equivalent determination assumes compliance with the
current Good Manufacturing Practice requirement, as set forth in the Quality System
Regulation (QS) for Medical Devices: General regulation (21 CFR Part 820) and that,
through periodic (QS) inspections, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will verify
such assumptions. Failure to comply with the GMP regulation may result in regulatory
action. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the
Federal Register. Please note: this response to your premarket notification submission does
not affect any obligation you might have under sections 531 through 542 of the Act for
devices under the Electronic Product Radiation Control provisions, or other Federal laws or
regulations.
