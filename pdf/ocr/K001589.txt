5100) Sumntary :
General Information;
This 510(k) is to provide notification of substantial equivalence for the Candela Dynamic Cooling Device,
which is substantially equivalent to previously marketed devices intended for cooling of the skin and
reduction of pain during laser treatment (K951033) and for protecting the dermis from thermal injury,
: which reduces possible side effects such as scabbing, scarring, and hyperpigmentation (K972347) and
allows for the utilization of higher laser fluences for laser treatment. ,

Date prepared: May 19, 2000
Classification: Class Il (21 CFR § 878.4810 Laser Surgical Instrument for use in
. General and Plastic Surgery and in Dermatology)
Trade Name: . Candela Dynamic Cooling Device
Common Name: Skin Refrigerant
Predicate Devices: Candela Dynamic Cooling Device cleared under 510{k} K951033 and
the Epidermal Chiller tip accessory to Coherent, Inc.'s Versapulse
: . Aesthetic Surgical Laser cleared under $10(k) K972347
Description:
Candela's Dynamic Cooling Device consists of 1) a source of skin refrigerant fluid (HFC 1342), 2) an ,
electronically controlled solenoid delivery valve, and 3) clectronic timing circuitry. The Dynamic Cooling
Device is commected in line with a laser's triggerswitch system so that activation of the triggerswitch
controls the delivery of a pulsed spray of HFC 134a just prior to the delivery of a laser pulse. The pulsed :
spray of skin refrigerant cools the skin zs it evaporates. Thermal injury to nan-vascular structures Is
minimized and pain associated with the lascr treatment is reduced.
The intended use of the Candela Dynamic Cooling Device is to minimize injury to the skin structures
during laser therapy of vascular lesions and hair removal, to reduce pain associated with laser treatment,
to allow far use of higher laser fluences and to reduce potential side effects of laser treatmeats, such as
hair removal and vascular lesions.
Summary of Substantial Equivalence;
The Candela Dynamic Cooling Device for the use of higher laser fluences and reduction of potential side
effects of laser treatments is substantially equivalent to the Candela Dynamic Cooling Device which has
been previously cleared for cooling of the skin prior to and reduction of pain during laser treatment.
(K95S1033). Operating principles materials, design, construction, methods of assembly and other intended
uses are the same as those for the predicate device. With respect to indications for use, Candeia’s Dynamic
Cooling device is also substantially equivalent to Coherent Inc,’s Epidermal Chiller tip accessory
(K972347).

Dear Ms. Clifford:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) notification of intent to market the device referenced
above and we have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for
use stated in the enclosure) to devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to
May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
, have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food; Drag;and .
Cosmetic Act (Act). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls
provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for
annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and
prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class if
(Premarket Approval), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major
regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21,
Parts 800 to 895. A substantially equivalent determination assumes compliance with the
. current Good Manufacturing Practice requirement, as set forth in the Quality System
Regulation (QS) for Medical Devices: General regulation (21 CFR Part 820) and that,
: through periodic (QS) inspections, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will verify
such assumptions. Failure to comply with the GMP regulation may result in regulatory
action. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the
Federal Register. Please note: this response to your premarket notification submission does
not affect any obligation you might have under sections 531 through 542 of the Act for
. devices under the Electronic Product Radiation Control provisions, or other Federal laws or
regulations. :

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a
legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits
: your device to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801
and additionally 809.10 for in vitro diagnostic devices), please contact the Office of :
Compliance at (301) 594-4595. Additionally, for questions on the promotion and
advertising of your device, please contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4639. .
