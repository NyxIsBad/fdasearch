Description:

The OmniGuide Zero Flow ZF-T 150 WaveGuide fiber is an accessory for CO2 laser
systems. It consists of a fiber assembly that propagates CO2 laser beams and vents the
cooling gases outside of the body. The OmniGuide ZF-T 150 wave guide fiber is
supplied sterile and is intended for single procedure use.

Intended Use:

The OmniGuide Zero Flow ZF-T 150 WaveGuide Fiber is indicated for the incision,
excision, ablation, vaporization and coagulation of body soft tissues including intraoral
tissues, in the medical specialties of general and plastic surgery, oral / maxillofacial
surgery, dentistry, dermatology, endoscopic and open surgical procedures related to
gynecology, otorhinolaryngology, gastroenterology, neurosurgery, pulmonary surgery
for surgical and aesthetic applications.

The indications for use for which the delivery system is used are dependent upon the
cleared indications for use of the laser system and those laser system accessories to
which it is attached.

Summary of Technological Characteristics:

The device consists of an optical fiber assembly. The main functional component of the
fiber assembly is a photonic bandgap reflector lining its hollow core that reflects and
thereby guides CO2 laser energy. The fiber incorporates a Jens at the tip which is
transparent to the laser beam. The fiber also incorporates a sensor on the fiber tip that
allows physicians to determine when the lens becomes obstructed by debris. The fiber
assembly is 1.5 m long and transmits at the CO2 laser emission wavelength of 10.6 pm.
Performance Data:

Non-clinical Performance Data: The OmniGuide Zero Flow ZF-T 150 WaveGuide
Fiber performance characteristics have been evaluated through testing and analysis of
laser power output and beam quality. This type of testing complies with the respective
section of the FDA Guidance on the Content and Organization of a Premarket
Notification for a Medical Laser (1995) and is similar to the predicate device tests. The
performance of OmniGuide Zero Flow ZF-T 150 WaveGuide Fiber and related
parameters of predicate devices are comparable.

Clinical Performance Data: Formal clinical trials were not deemed necessary as the
device is using the same technology and intended use as predicate devices.

Conclusions Drawn from Tests and Analysis:

The intended use and major performance parameters (energy transmission levels and
beam quality) of the OmniGuide Zero Flow ZF-T 150 WaveGuide Fiber are similar or
equivalent to same characteristics of above mentioned legally marketed devices.

Dear Mr. Job :
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal F ood, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
gencral controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
“Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
