Predicate Devices

: The family of IRIS Medical EndoProbe handpieces is substantially equivalent in

intended use and/or method of operation to other currently legally marketed laser
probes including IRIDEX Corporation’s IRIS Medical EndoProbe (K020374), the
Alcon Endolaser Probes (K962592), the HGM Illuminating and Aspirating Probes
(K931784 and K925663), the STI Aspirating Endo Ocular Probe with [Illumination
(K921488), and the Infinitech Aspirating Laser Probe (K946135).

Device Description
The family of IRIS Medical EndoProbe handpieces is comprised of the following
main components: a universal SMA style input connector, a glass fiber optic protected
by a PVC (vinyl) jacket, a handle, and a medical grade stainless steel needle. The
Illuminating EndoProbe has an additional illumination fiber optic with jacket.

Intended Use
The family of IRIS Medical EndoProbe handpieces is intended for use in performing
ophthalmic laser treatments to deliver laser energy to the treatment area inside the
eye, the aspiration function is indicated for use when unwanted fluid is present in the
eye causing refraction or scattering of the laser beam from the intended treatment site,
and the illumination function is indicated for use to illuminate the interior of the eye.
The handpieces are offered in straight or angled styles, and with a universal SMA
connector that allows the family of EndoProbe handpieces to be used with compatible
laser systems, such as IRIS Medical and Lumenis. The handpieces are cleared for use
for the particular indications of the laser system to which they are attached.
