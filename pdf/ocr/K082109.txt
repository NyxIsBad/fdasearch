5100k) SUMMARY (As Required per 21 CFR 807.92(c))
DEVICE OPERATION:
The Bovic ICON GP (the Generator) operates by delivering high frequency radiofrequency (RF)
energy which, when used in conjunction with other clectrosurgical accessories, is used to cul,
coagulate, and seal tissues or vessels. There is a characteristic electrical wave form associated
with each mode. The electrical properties of the waveform (frequency and duration) produce the
clinical effect (i.e. cul, coagulation, seal). The shape and duration of waveforms are comparable
between the generator and predicate devices.
The Generator functions in any of sixteen user selectable modes:

1. Pure Cut 2. Blend Mode 1

3. Blend Mode 2 4. Blend Mode 3

5. Special Cut 6. Laparoscopic Cut

7. Pinpoint Coagulation 8. Gentle Coagulation

9. Spray Coagulation 10. Laparoscopic Coagulation

11, Macro Bipolar 12. Micro Bipolar

13. Gentle Bipolar 14. Auto Stop Bipolar

15. Vessel Seal 16. Vessel Seal and Cut
The generator is designed to comply with applicable Medical Electrical Equipment safety
standards, including electromagnetic compatibility and other safety standards.
The Generator uses technology substantially equivalent to the predicate devices. The generator
incorporates an ergonomically designed user interface screen for the selection of device settings.
Although different from the user interface of the predicate devices, the difference does not affect
the safety and effectiveness and may provide improved visualization of the device settings.
There are no new hazards presented with the use of the Bovie ICON GP generator as compared
with the named predicate device.
INTENDED USE:
The Bovie ICON GP Generator is used to deliver high frequency radiofrequency energy in
conjunction with other surgical devices for electrosurgical cutting, coagulation, or vessel sealing.

Dear Mr. Kozloff:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class I] (Special Controls) or class Ill (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean

: or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation contro! provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 — Mr. Richard A Kozloff
