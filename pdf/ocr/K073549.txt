Device Trade Name: Quanta System Q-Plus T
Common Name: Laser surgical instrument for use in general surgery and
dermatology
Classification Instrument, surgical, powered, laser
Name:
Predicate Devices: - Cynosure, Inc Affinity QS Q-Switched Nd:YAG
Laser System (K050382);
- ASCLEPION LASER TECHNOLOGIES GmbH
TattooStar R (K060787 )
Intended Use / Nd:YAG (1064nm) and (532nm)
Indications for Use:
The Q-Plus T Q-Switched laser is intended for
treatment of vascular lesions, pigmented lesions, and
for hair, tattoo removal and the incision, excision,
ablation, vaporization of soft tissue for general
dermatology.
Ruby (694nm)
The Q-Plus T Q-Switched laser is intended for use for
cutting, vaporization and ablation of soft tissue and the
removal of tattoos and benign pigment lesion.
Some examples of pigment lesions are
* Lentigines
* café-au-lait-blotches

« Ephalides
« Benign Naevi such as:
« Naevus of Ota
= Naevus of Ito
* Epidermal Naevi
» Congenital Naevi
« Beckers Naevi
* Blue Nevus
« Naevus Spillus
* Mongolian Spot
Technological The device includes a Q-Switched Nd:YAG laser source
Characteristics: with 1000mJ max energy at 1064 nm and 500mJ max
energy at 532 nm wavelengths, and a Q-Switched Ruby
laser source with 1000mJ max energy at 694nm
wavelength. The optical delivery system for the three
wavelengths is the articulated arm.
In addition, the Q-Plus T includes a power supply; a
cooling system; an optical delivery system; a
microprocessor based controller; and safety features to
ensure use of the appropriate laser, wavelength and
hand piece.
Performance Data None
Substantial The Quanta System Q-Plus-T is as safe and effective as
Equivalence: the predicate devices. The Q-Plus T has the same
intended uses and similar indications, technological
characteristics, and principles of operation as its
predicate device. The minor technological differences
between the Q-Plus T and its predicate devices raise no
new issues of safety or effectiveness. Thus, the Q-Plus
T is substantially equivalent.

Dear Mr. Job:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class IIT (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CEFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance
at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address
