F. Intended Use
The VasoView 6 Harvesting Cannula is intended for cutting and
coagulation of tissue and providing access in minimally invasive vessel
harvesting procedures for patients undergoing coronary artery bypass
grafting.

G. Substantial Equivalence
The VasoView 6 Harvesting Cannula is substantially equivalent to the
VasoView 5 Harvesting Cannula, cleared by the Food and Drug
Administration under KO20143 on February 20, 2002. The design of the
VasoView 6 Harvesting Cannula is identical to the current device with the
exception of the modification of the blades and electrode configuration,

Dear Ms. Weidman:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean

or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation contro! provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Device Name: VasoView® 6 Harvesting Cannula .. , :

Indications For Use:
The VasoView® 6 Harvesting Cannula has applications in minimally invasive
surgery and is primarily indicated for patients undergoing endoscopic surgery for
vessel harvesting. It is indicated for cutting tissue and controlling bleeding
through coagulation in general and cardiothoracic surgery including minimally
invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB), lower extremity and
thoracoscopic procedures. Lower extremity procedures include tissue
dissection/vessel harvesting along the saphenous vein for use in coronary artery
bypass grafting and peripheral artery bypass. Thoracoscopic procedures include
exposure and dissection of structures external to the parietal pleura, including
nerves, blood vessels and other tissues of the chest wall.
