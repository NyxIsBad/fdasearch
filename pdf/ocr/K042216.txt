2. Name of Device
Trade or Proprietary Name: Cool-tip™ RF Ablation System
Common/Classification Name: Electrosurgical Cutting and Coagulation
Device and Accessories
3. Predicate Devices
The Cool-tip™ RF Ablation System is substantially equivalent to the following
legally marketed medical devices:
Y¥ Cool-tip™ RF Ablation System (K984552)
v RITA Medical Systems RF Generator and Accessories (K993944,
K021329, K031257 and K031926)
v¥ RadioTherapeutics RF Generator and LeVeen Electrode (K012315
and K000241)
4. Device Description
The Cool-tip™ RF Ablation System consists of a microprocessor based RF
generator, a peristaltic pump, electrodes, inflow and outflow tubing for electrode
cooling, and return pads. The generator, pump and electrodes are designed to
produce local tissue heating at the tip of the electrodes causing the coagulation
(ablation) of the tissue.
The Cool-tip™ RF Ablation System generator is capable of delivering up to 200
watts (into a 50 Ohm resistive load) while monitoring tissue impedance and
electrode tip temperature during the delivery of the RF energy. The generator
includes manual and impedance control and displays/monitors impedance,
current, power and temperature.

The Cool-tip™ electrodes are available in either a single electrode or a cluster
electrode configuration. The electrodes are monopolar devices. The cluster
electrode is three electrode shafts combined into one handle in a triangular
patter with approximately 0.5 cm. separation. The electrodes are provided
sterile, for single use only. The shaft of the electrode is stainless steel that is
insulated to various lengths from the tip of the electrode. Embedded within the
tip of each electrode is a thermocouple for temperature measurement. Cooling
of the electrode is provided by chilled sterile water which is pumped (using the
peristaltic pump) through the inflow tubing, the electrode and out through the
outflow tubing. This is an enclosed system within the electrode and the sterile
water does not contact the patient. Because of the monopolar nature of the
electrodes, electrical current flows through the tip of the electrode, through the
target tissue and to the return pad.

5. Intended Use
The Cool-tip™ RF Ablation System (Generator and Accessories) is intended for
use in percutaneous, laparoscopic and intraoperative coagulation and ablation of
tissue, such as partial or complete ablation of non-resectable liver lesions.

6. Summary of Technological Characteristics
The Cool-tip™ RF Ablation System has the same basic technological
characteristics as the predicate devices noted above.

7. Performance and Clinical Data
Comparative in vivo and ex vivo product testing has shown the Cool-tip™ RF
Ablation System to be equivalent to currently marketed devices with regard to
coagulation/ablation of lesions. Independent clinical studies have shown the use
of the system to be clinically safe and effective for ablation of non-resectable
liver lesions.

Trade/Device Name: Cool-tip™ RF Ablation System
Regulation Number: 21 CFR 878.4400
Regulation Name: Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation device and accessories
Regulatory Class: II
Product Code: GEI
Dated: August 13, 2004
Received: August 16, 2004
Dear Mr. Copperberg:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class I] (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 - Mr. Charles M. Copperberg
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21 CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
(301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address http://www. fda.gov/cdrh/dsma/dsmamain.html
