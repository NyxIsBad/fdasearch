2. Device Name and Classification:
Trade Name: LightLance™ Laser Skin Perforator
Classification Name: Laser instrument, surgical, powered
Common Name: Laser Skin Perforator
Classification Panel: General and Plastic Surgery: Panel 79
CFR Section: 21 CFR §878.4810
Device Class: Class II
3. Substantial Equivalence:
The LightLance™ Laser Skin Perforator substantially equivalent to the current, legally
marketed LASETTE™ (k983673) and (k981746). The LightLance™ Laser Skin
Perforator has the same intended use and general and specific indications as both of
predicated Lasette devices. These devices have very similar principles of operation and
technological characteristics. The minor technological differences do not raise any new
questions of safety and effectiveness. Performance data demonstrates that LightLance™ is as
safe and effective as the Lasette.
4. Device Description:
The LightLance™ Laser Skin Perforator is a pulsed erbium doped yittrium-aluminum/ garnet (Er: YAG) laser. It outputs a single pulse of laser light with a wavelength of 2940 nm,

which ablates a small hole in the skin to a depth sufficient to access capillary blood.

5, Intended Use/Indications for Use:
The LightLance™ Laser Skin Perforator is intended to be used for ablation of skin tissue to
establish capillary blood access, The LightLance™ Laser Skin Perforator general indication
for use is for the perforation of skin to draw capillary blood for screening purposes. The
device is specifically indicated for obtaining capillary blood samples for subsequent analysis of
blood glucose concentration in both institutional and home settings.
6. Performance Data:
The LightLance™ Laser Skin Perforator has been thoroughly tested according to international
standards equivalent to the standard IEC 601. Results from the testing indicate that the device
is as safe and effective as the predicate device.
7. Conclusion:
The LightLance™ Laser Skin Perforator is substantially equivalent to the current legally
marketed Cell Robotics Lasette (k983673, k981746).

Dear Mr. Holstein:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications :
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may

or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

: "Page 2 — Mr. Howard Holstein — me Be .
