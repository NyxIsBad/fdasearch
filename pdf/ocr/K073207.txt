Device Description: The Olympus Electrosurgical System is an electrosurgical system consisting of the Olympus ESG-100 electrosurgical generator, in conjunction with the footswitch and the peristaltic flushing pump Olympus
AFU-100. The Olympus ESG-100 is designed to perform monopolar
and bipolar functions in the operating arena. The AFU-100 flushing
pump Is intended for irrigation of instruments or irrigation/lushing/cleansing of tissue surfaces and wounds supporting endoscopic diagnosis or therapy.
Olympus ESG-100
The ESG-100 is a reusable, non-sterile electrosurgical generator that
features different mono- and bipolar cutting and coagulation modes. It
has two displays. One display shows the selected power level, the
300002

b 0 7 jv faze 3 4 ST

ie
other display shows the currently selected program mode. Buttons are
used fo set the power level or to change the modes. Different connectors allow connecting mono- and bipolar electrosurgical instruments, a
neutrat electrode, a footswitch, or an ancillary pump. The maximum
output power is 120 W.
Application Mades:
Monopolar Cut: Three continuous cutting modes (Cut 1, Cut 2, and
Cut 3) for standard tissue cutting; two intermittent cutting modes
(PulseCut Slow and PulseCut Fast) for siow and controlled tissue cutting.
Monopolar Coagulation: One mode for standard coagulation procedures (SoftCoag); two modes for forced coagulation (ForcedCoag 1,
ForeedCoag 2).
Bipolar Cut: Three continuous cutting modes for standard tissue cutting applications (Cut 1, Cut 2, and Cut 3).
Bipolar Coagulation: Three bipolar coagulation modes (SoftCoag,
RFCoag, RFCoag + RCAP). SoftCoag is used for standard coagulation and hemostasis. RFCoag is used for controlled coagulation. It
features acoustic resistance feedback and an automatic end of procedure detection. RFCoag + RCAP is especially suited for deep tissue
coagulation without significant tissue desiccation; it also features an
end of procedure detection.
The modes have preset power levels that may be customized by the
user in a defined range.
Design:
The design of the Olympus ESG-100 complies with the following standards:
{EC 60601-1
UL 60601-1
IEC 60601-1-2
IEG 60601-1-4
IEC 60601-1-6
IEC 60601-2-2
ISO 14971
Olympus AFU-100
The AFU-100 peristaltic flushing pump employs tubing to deliver fluid
to the tissue/mucosa. Sterile liquids (e.g. isotonic saline solution) thus
remain sterile, provided that a sterile tube set is used.

eet

The maximum flow rate is 270 ml and 600 ml per minute with two different tube sets offered as single use items (see Figure 2). In addition,
three memory buttons provide fast access to preset flow levels. The
AFU-100 can be connected to the electrosurgical generator ESG-100
by an interface, allowing operation of the peristaltic pump unit by a
special button of the electrosurgical unit's footswitch.
The pump rotor is equipped with a protective cover, which automatically stops the rollers from rotating if it is apened while the peristaltic
pump unit is activated, and thus prevents possible injuries.
Design:
The design of the Olympus AFU-100 complies with the following standards:
IEC 60601-1
UL 60601-1
IEC 60601-1-2
IEC 60601-1-4
IEC 60601-1-6

Accessories
A-Cord: The A-cord is used to connect active instruments to the Olympus ESG-100.
P-Cord: The P-cord is used to connect a neutral electrade to the Olympus ESG-100.
Footswitch (ESG-100): The footswitch of the ESG-100 is connected
with a cable to the generator. It has a yellow CUT and a blue COAG
pedal. An additional button allows switching between the application
modes or to activate the pump flow, if an ancillary pump unit is connected.
Footswitch (AFU-100): The footswitch is an optional accessory to the
AFU-100. it has one pedal to activate and deactivate the pump.
Pump Tube: There are two different sizes of pump tubes available.
The tubes are inserted into the pump head and connect the liquid
source with the surgical instrument.

Intended Use: The Olympus Electrosurgical System is an electrosurgical system consisting of the Olympus ESG-100 electrosurgical generator, in conjunction with the footswitch and the peristaltic flushing pump Olympus
AFU-100. The Olympus ESG-100 is designed to perform monopolar
and bipolar functions in the operating arena. The AFU-100 flushing
pump is intended for irrigation of instruments or irrigation/flushing/cleansing of tissue surfaces and wounds supporting endoscopic diagnosis or therapy.

cessories and ERBE EIP 2. In addition, these two systems have similar technological characteristics.
The subject ESG-100 has the same indication statement, the same
intended use statement and similar technological characteristics as the
predicates {CC 200 and VIO 300 D.
The ENDO CUT mode of the predicate ICC 200 offers an equivalent to
the PulseCut slow / fast of the subject ESG-100. The predicate VIO
300 D and the subject ESG-100 are suitable for bipolar cutting. There
are minor differences in the output characteristics and the quantity of
the application modes, the maximum output power, or the handling,
but they do not change the safety and effectiveness or result in new
potential risks.
The subject Olympus AFU-100 has the same indication statement and
similar technological characteristics as the predicate Olympus OFP-1.
It also has the same intended use and technological characteristics as
the Erbe EIP 2. However, the EIP 2 has been registered under a different product code. Nevertheless the intended use statements and
the technological characteristics of the predicates EIP 2 and OFP-1
are substantial equivalent to the Olympus AFU-100.

Conclusion: The data show that the differences between the subject Olympus Electrosurgical System and the predicate devices do not affect the safety
and effectiveness, as no changes were incorporated in the intended
use, in the performance, and in the physical principles that the system
is based upon. Therefore, no additional tests are necessary for evaluation of safety and efficacy. Nevertheless bench tests of the subject
ESG-100 and the predicate devices ICC 200 and VIO 300 D were performed and demonstrate substantial equivalence.

Dear Ms. Storms-Tyler:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21

CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act), 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, “Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
