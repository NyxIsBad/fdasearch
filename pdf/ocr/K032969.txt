It consists of two parts:

* A power generator control unit with a Helium gas supply.
¢ An application probe.
An ionised gas plasma flame is generated in a controlled Helium gas flow at the end
of a 4mm PTFE application tube (the probe). This produces a corona-type flame
issuing from the open end of the probe with a high electron temperature but low
molecular temperature of about 20C, When the probe is brought close (within 3 mm)
to a surface connected to earth ~ such as human tissue — the corona-type flame
changes to an arc discharge flame with a temperature of approx. 800C, The inert
Helium gas flow in which the discharge takes place protects the area of discharge and
minimises oxidation. ‘
This plasma flame can be used to stop blood flow from damaged tissue by
cauterisation.
The electrical generator provides an alternating current at a fixed frequency in the kilo
hertz range with a power supply range of between 2 and 30W.
Referring to the application probe, which the model is the LT, the L is for
Laparoscopic and the T is the length.
The new probe is the LTC. This is a cutting probe where the 4mm PTFE tube retracts,
exposing the point which is approximately 8-10n1m long. This probe works by using
the Corona flame passing between the point and the tissue at the nearest point which
could be on the side of the probe. The point area which is hot then cuts through the
tissue and cauterises small blood vessels as it passes through.
Statement of Intended. Use:
“The device is ahelium gas electrosurgical cutting and coagulator for use in all soft
tissue sutgery-laparoscopic ,eudoscopic and open ”.
Description of Modification:
The basic design of the Helica probe remains the same, However the handle of the
LTC probe has been modified to allow the PTFE sheath to be retracted; this exposes
the brass insert, which can then be used as a cutting instrument.
Summary of Non Clinical Tests:
In vitro comparison of the Helica thermal coagulator (HTC) and the argon beam
coagulater (ABC); Dr. John Webb, Ph.D:
36

KOBLILY (99 3 oF YD
The helium unit does have a much better control of the depth of necrosis than that of
the ABC, but slightly less contro! over the width, perhaps due to the significantly
greater power applied by the ABC to get the same effect. However, the judgement of
effect of each of these unite while in use during surgery is visual and it will be easy to
judge the spread of the effect and not easy to judge the depth.
It can therefore be concluded that the use of the HTC should be easier than the AB,
even given similar results, and the HTC should be considered “safer” with its much
lower power at point of application.
Substantial Equivalence:
The has the following similarities to those which previously received 510(k)
clearance:
: « have the same indicated use,

* use the same operating principle,

* incorporate the same design,

* incorporate the same materials,

« have the same shelf life,

« and are packaged using the same materials and processes
In summary, described in this submission is substantially equivalent to the predicate
device.

Dated: January 15, 2004
Received: January 21, 2004
Dear Dr. Webb:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug.
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class NI (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, ‘litle 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CIR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation contro! provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act), 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 - John B. Webb. Ph.D.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.

. If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Also, please note the regulation entitled, :
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
