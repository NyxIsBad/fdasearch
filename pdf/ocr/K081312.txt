The technological characteristics and indications for use of the Aragon Surgical
System are similar to those of the cited predicate electrosurgical devices, as well as
the similar RF Systems distributed by other manufacturers. These devices are
equivalent in terms of design, materials, principal of operation, and product
specifications. Any differences between the Aragon Surgical System and the
predicate devices do not raise new issues regarding safety or effectiveness.
PERFORMANCE DATA
Results of bench and pre-clinical evaluations were used to demonstrate that the
Aragon Surgical System is substantially equivalent to the predicate devices and meets
design, safety, and effectiveness criteria.
CONCLUSION
Based on the design, materials, function, intended use, and pre-clinical evaluation, the
Aragon Surgical System is substantially equivalent to the devices currently marketed
under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Sufficient data were obtained to
demonstrate that the device is substantially equivalent to the predicate devices and
raises no new safety or effectiveness issues. Therefore, safety and effectiveness are
reasonably assured, justifying 510(k) clearance for commercial sale.

Dear Mr. Curtis:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device

for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and .
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may

Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
