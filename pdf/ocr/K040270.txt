VI. Rationale for Substantial Equivalence
The OpusDent Family of Er:YAG and CO2/Er:YAG Combination Laser Products (and
the delivery accessories that are used with them to deliver laser energy) share the same or
similar indications for use, device operation, overall technical and functional capabilities,
and therefore are substantially equivalent for use in general and plastic surgery, and
dentistry for surgical applications to the predicate OpusDent Duo, OpusDent 20, and
OpusDent Spectra (K021508), the Stryker Total Performance System (TPS) (K032117
and K991696), and the Hoya Conbio VersaWave Dental Er:YAG Laser System
(K041710).
VIL Safety and Effectiveness Information
Review of indications for use and technical characteristics and data provided were used to
support the safety and effectiveness and substantial equivalence of the OpusDent Family
of Er:YAG and CO2/Er:YAG Combination Laser Products for use in specific applications
in the medical specialties of general and plastic surgery, and dentistry.
VOI. Conclusion
The OpusDent Family of Er:YAG'and CO2/Er:Y AG Combination Laser Products (and the
delivery accessories that are used with them to deliver laser energy) was found to be
substantially equivalent to the predicate OpusDent Duo, OpusDent 20, and OpusDent
Spectra (K021508), the Stryker Total Performance System (TPS) (K032117 and
K991696), and the Hoya Conbio VersaWave Dental Er: YAG Laser System (K041710).
The OpusDent Family of Er:YAG and CO2/Er:YAG Combination Laser Products (and the
delivery accessories that are used with them to deliver laser energy) shares the same
indications for use, and similar design features, and functional features, and thus are
substantially equivalent to the predicate devices,

Dear Ms. Worden:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
