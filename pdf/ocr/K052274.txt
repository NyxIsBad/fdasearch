Summary of The design, materials, method of delivery, and intended use features of the

substantial Guidant VasoView® HemoPro™ Endoscopic Vessel Harvesting System are

equivalence substantially equivalent with regard to those features in the predicate devices:
the VV4 (K030512, May 14, 2003), and the VV6 (K041981, August 20, 2004).

Device The Guidant VasoView® HemoPro™ Endoscopic Vessel Harvesting System is

description designed for use in conjunction with the 7 mm Endoscope. The Harvesting
Cannula has four lumens which house the Endoscope, C-Ring, distal lens washer
tube and VasoView® HemoPro™ Harvesting Tool for cutting and sealing of
vessel branches. The C-Ring/distal lens washer is independently controlled by a
C-Ring Slider on the handle of the device that retracts the vessel and washes the
distal tip of the Endoscope. The Harvesting Tool can be extended/retracted from
the main cannula by inserting it into the Tool Adapter Port, and rotated
independently. The Harvesting Tool has two curved Jaws. One Jaw contains the
heating elements for branch cutting and sealing; the second Jaw is longer and has
a serrated inner edge. Cutting and sealing of vessel branches is achieved in two
steps: (1) capture of the branch between the Jaws of the Harvesting Tool and
then (2) simultaneous coagulation and ligation of the branch with the Jaws using
direct current. Both steps are achieved by mechanical application of the
Activation Toggle. Positioning of the device, cutting, and sealing are performed
under endoscopic visualization. This device is intended for specific use with the
VasoView® HemoPro™ Power Supply.

Special 510(k)
Indications for | The VasoView® HemoPro™ System is indicated for use in minimally invasive
Use surgery allowing access for vessel harvesting, and is primarily indicated for
patients undergoing endoscopic surgery for arterial bypass. It is indicated for
cutting tissue and controlling bleeding through coagulation, and for patients
requiring blunt dissection of tissue including dissection of blood vessels,
dissection of blood vessels of the extremities, dissection of ducts and other
structures in the extraperitoneal or subcutaneous extremity and thoracic space.
Extremity procedures include tissue dissection/vessel harvesting along the
saphenous vein for use in coronary artery bypass grafting and peripheral artery
bypass or radial artery for use in coronary artery bypass grafting. Thoracoscopic
procedures include exposure and dissection of structures external to the parietal
pleura, including nerves, blood vessels and other tissues of the chest wall.
Technological The Guidant VasoView® HemoPro™ Endoscopic Vessel Harvesting System
characteristics incorporates the same fundamental scientific technology as the predicate devices.
Performance The results of the verification testing demonstrate that the Guidant VasoView®
data HemoPro™ Endoscopic Vessel Harvesting System meet the established
acceptance criteria and performs in a manner equivalent to the predicate devices.
No new safety or effectiveness issues were raised during the testing program.
