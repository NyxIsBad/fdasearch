Regulatory Affairs Manager
Common/Usual Name: Electrosurgical Instruments
Classification Name: Electrosurgical Cutting and Coagulation Device And Accessories

(21 CFR 878.4400)
Proprietary Name: Zip Open Forceps with Electrosurgical Cut
The device is a Class II medical device. The Zip Open Forceps with Electrosurgical Cut is a
modification to the predicate device cleared under K000496. The Open Forceps is similar in
construction and in component materials when compared to the predicate device. The indications
for use are similar to the predicate devices cleared under K000496 and K904993. The device
consists of grasping jaws connected to a handle. The handle has finger loops integrated into it to
allow the physician to easily manipulate the device for grasping, dissection, electrosurgical
coagulation and cutting. The overall length of the device is nine (9) inches. The device will be
available in three distinct jaw configurations. The intended use of the device is to electrosurgically
coagulate and cut tissue as well as to grasp and dissect tissue during the performance of open
general surgical procedures. The energy source, Bipolar Electrosurgical Energy, is the same energy
type as used for the predicate devices. The forceps jaws are electrically isolated from each other
enabling one jaw to act as a return electrode, eliminating the need for a return pad. In addition, one
jaw contains a second electrically isolated electrode element to effect electrosurgical cutting.
In conclusion, as the design, materials of construction, function and intended use of the Zip Open
Forceps with Electrosurgical Cut is similar to that of the predicate devices currently cleared, Gyrus
Medical Inc. believes that no new issues of safety and effectiveness are raised and that the
submitted device is substantially equivalent.
