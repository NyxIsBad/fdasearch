Common Name: ElectroSurgical Unit (ESU/Generator) System
Trade/Proprietary Name: ERBE ESU Model VIO 300 D with Accessories
Classification Name: Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation device and
accessories (21 CFR 878.4400)
Product Code: GEl
Legally Marketed
Predicate Device: : ERBE VIO ESU (Model VIO 300 D) with Accessories
510(k) Numbers: K023886 and K060484
Device Description:
The ERBE ESU Model VIO 300 D with Accessories is an electrosurgical system that uses
High Frequency (HF) electrical current waveforms to cut and/or coagulate tissue. There are
modifications made to only a few of the Accessories from the previously cleared 510(k)
Number K023886 and they are included within this submission.
ESU Model VIO 300 D
The ESU has a color monitor display that provides the user with an on-screen tutorial as
well as settings and operational information. The unit has various cutting and coagulation
modes with defined effect levels to provide the physician flexibility in interventional
applications (i.e. its ability to generate HF current). The system has automatic start and
stop features. The equipment is programmable and various accessories (e.g.
footswitches, hand instruments, etc.) as well as modes may be assigned to perform
specific functions. When activated, the device has an audio and visual error system (i.e.,
malfunctions or user errors are detected with medical personnel being alerted visually
and/or by sound with, in some cases, no energy being delivered). Upon activation, the
energy delivered (in watts) from the ESU to the tissue is displayed on the display screen.

Also, the Unit can be used in association with an ERBE compatible Argon Plasma
Coagulator (APC). The ESU is supplied non-sterile and is reusable,
Accessories (Modified VIO Footswitches)
Various types of single and double pedal Footswitches have been designed for ESU VIO
Models. The Footswitches are used to activate the Generator. Some of the Footswitches
have a ReMode button so that the physician can toggle between preset programs. Also,
some Footswitches are equipped with a bracket (i.e. bar) so that the operator can position
their foot.
Note: VIO stands for Variable Cut and Coagulation.
Indications for Use:
The ERBE ESU Model VIO 300 D with Accessories is intended to deliver High Frequency
(HF) electrical current for the cutting and/or coagulation of tissue.
Similarities and Differences of the Modified Device to the Current Device (Predicate
Comparison/Substantial Equivalence):
Similarities
ESU Model VIO 300 D
The modified ESU has the same intended use, protective circuits, and uses the same
basic accessories (i.e. A/C Cord, Adapters, etc.) as the predicate. Also, the Modes with
and without Auto Stop in the modified device are the same Modes that are in the
predicate. Both Generators have an on-screen tutorial as well as the same user
interface display to select modes, power settings, etc. The modified and predicate
devices are programmable and have ReMode capabilities. Both devices have Auto Start
and Auto Stop functions. Also, each Unit has audio and visual error monitoring. The
modified and predicate devices both can be used with a compatible Argon Plasma
Coagulator (APC) with the respective APC being controlled through the ESU. Both Units
have the actual software for the APC within the ESU. The APC related Modes for the
modified device are the same as the predicate device. The modified ESU is also
manufactured by ERBE Elektromedizin GmbH in Germany and like the predicate
Generator will be supplied as non-sterile and is reusable. The packaging is also the
same for each device with similar labeling (e.g. Outer Package Label, User Manual,
etc.).
Accessories (Modified VIO Footswitches)
The modified Footswitches are manufactured with the same type of materials and have
the same functions as well as features as the predicate Footswitches. The packaging is
also the same for each device with similar labeling (e.g. Outer Package Labels and
Notes On Use, etc.).

Differences

ESU Model VIO 300 D

The modified ESU has the following changes or additions:

Hardware

* The method for installing an optional software mode utilizes a communications
cable with a “serialized” dongle which requires changes to the internal
communications Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs).

* Several internal PCBs are upgraded with more robust components to prevent
field issues and errors.

* The display is more durable and the anti-reflective coating on the display screen
is improved.

* The monopolar receptacle was improved to prevent the connection of instrument
cables being inserted into the wrong holes of the module.

e An additional type of bipolar receptacle was created to further meet customer's
needs.

Software

* Software changes are made to correct field issues and incorrect error situations.

« With some of the modes, the association of effects with power (outputs) and
resistance were optimized and crest factors changed.

« Some visual cues and audio cues were improved (e.g. lighting of specific icons,
change in tone or increased sound for a mode or feature, added power display for
specific bipolar modes).

« The Endo Cut “I” and BiClamp modes have higher maximum output powers for
the availability of more power if needed.

e The Auto Start and Auto Stop features are now available with additional modes.

e An additional feature was created for the Neutral Electrode Safety SYstem
(NESSY) involving the use of a Neonatal Neutral Electrode (NE) (also referred to
as Return Electrode, Patient Pad, Patient Plate, Grounding Pad, etc.). With the
feature being turned “On", the Unit will display the message: "NE Neonatal
Monitoring - reduce the effect or power setting" if a current of 300mA is reached.

« Upon connecting a recognized reusable instrument into the Unit, the following
additional message displays: "the instrument has already been sterilized around
xx times" to provide usage information.

e An additional method for toggling between preset programs (i.e. the ReMode
feature) was added. That is, toggling between preset programs can be done by
simultaneously pushing the Cut (Yellow) and Coag (Blue) buttons of a handswitch
device.

e« A “Maximum application time” setting is added to the Precise APC mode to
reduce the possibility of thermal damage with the mode.

e Added identification field so that its identity can be displayed when the Unit is
turned “On”

e The maximum voltage for High Cut and Argon-Assisted High Cut modes has
been changed in the User Manual from being the average value to the maximum
number with the tolerance added.
Accessories (Modified VIO Footswitches)
Footswitches with different configurations (i.e. single or double pedals, with or without
ReMode, and with or without a bar) have been developed. Also, the Footswitches will
be manufactured in house at ERBE Elektromedizin GmbH.
All of the modifications (i.e., additions and changes) for the ERBE ESU Model VIO 300 D
with Accessories have been verified or validated in design control. All of the changes and
additions as necessary are reflected in the labeling.
Conclusion:
The ERBE ESU Model ViO 300 D with Accessories has the same intended use, principles of
operation, and technological characteristics as the predicate devices in the previously cleared
510(k)s. All of the modifications have been verified or validated in design control. In
conclusion, there are no issues with the ERBE ESU Model VIO 300 D with Accessories that
would raise additional safety or efficacy issues when compared to the predicate devices.
