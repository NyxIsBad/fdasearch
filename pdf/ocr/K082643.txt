Device Classification Electrosurgical cutting and coagulating device and accessories have
been classified as Class II, GEI (21 CFR 878.4400).

Device Description The device description of the VAPR 3.5 mm and 2.3 mm Electrodes
(end effect, side effect, wedge, angled, hook, flex, side effect short
and wedge short) with Integrated Handpiece is as follows.

The DePuy Milck VAPR System is designed for arthroscopic surgical
procedures. The System consists of a high frequency Electrosurgical
Generator, disposable Electrodes with integrated Handpiece, and a ‘
Footswitch. The components are designed and intended to be operated
as a single unit.
The device description of the VAPR TC Electrode with Integrated
Handpiece is as follows.
The VAPR Temperature Control Electrode is a soft tissue desiccation
device intended for use with the VAPR Systems, Ulilization witha
VAPR System allows the tip temperature of the electrode to be
indicated on the generator display.
The device description of the VAPR Suction Electrodes (S” and S™)

. isas follows.
The VAPR Suction Electrodes are soft tissue ablation and desiccation
devices intended for use with the VAPR System. They extend the
utility of the system by removing bubbles created during activation
from the operating site.

Indications for Use The VAPR Electrodes (end effect, side effect, wedge, angled, hook,
flex, side effect short and wedge short) and VAPR Suction
Electrodes (S” and S®) with Integrated Handpiece with Integrated
Handpiecc, when used with the DePuy Mitek VAPR Electrosurgical
System, are intended for resection, ablation, excision of soft tissue,
hemostasis of blood vessels and coagulation of soft tissues in patients
requiring arthroscopic surgery of the knee, shoulder, ankle, elbow and
wrist.

The VAPR TC Electrode with Integrated Handpiece, when used
with the DePuy Mitek VAPR Electrosurgical System, is intended for
coagulation of soft tissues in patients requiring arthroscopic surgery of
the knee, shoulder, ankle, elbow, and wrist.

Safety and Performance In support of the 510(k), Mitek has provided certification of compliance
to 21 CFR 820.30 Design Control requirements, descriptions of Mitek’s
subcontractor Design Control and Risk Analysis procedures, and the
resulls of validation testing (performance testing) for the device
modification.
Based on the Indications for Use, technological characteristics and
safely and performance testing, the VAPR Electrodes (end effect, side
effect, wedge, angled, hook, flex, side effect short and wedge short),
VAPR TC Electrode and VAPR Suction Electrodes (S” and S°")
with Integrated Handpiece have been shown to be substantially
equivalent to predicate devices under the Federal Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act.

Received: November 26, 2008
Dear Ms. Liu:
We have reviewed your Scction 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must ‘
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 - Ms. Zheng Liu :
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health's (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at :
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
