Dear Mr. Trost:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
: referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed im interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food. Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (sec above) into either class {I (Special Controls) or class HE (PMA). it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting vour device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Vitle 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition. FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Picase be advised that I'DA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencics. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including. but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 535-542 of the Act), 21 CPR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Smali
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
(301) 443-6597 or at its Intemet address http://www. fda.pow/edrh/industry/supporl/index.hunl.

510(k) Number (if known): K O50 293
Device Name: Fotona XP Plus Nd:YAG Family of Laser Systems
Indications For Use: .
Removal of unwanted hair, for stable long term or permanent hair reduction and for treatment of
PFB. The lasers are indicated on all skin types Fitzpatrick I-VI including tanned skin.

. Photocoagulation and hemostasis of pigmented and vascular lesions, such as but not limited to
port wine stains, hemoangioma, warts, telangiectasia, rosacea, Venus lake, leg veins and spider
veins.

Coagulation and hemostasis of soft tissue.

Incision/excision of soft body tissue in dermatology

Soft tissue general surgery applications-skin incision; tissue dissection; compelte or partial
resection of internal organs, tumors, lesions; tissue ablation; vessel coagulation.

Benign pigmented lesions such as, but not limited to, lentigos (age spots), solar lentigos (sun
spots), café au lait macules, seborrheic keratosis, nevi, chloasma, verrucae, skin tags, keratosis,

* tattoos (significant reduction in the intensity of black and/or blue-black tatoos) and plaques. The
laser is indicated for pigmented lesions to reduce lesion size, for patients with lesions that would
potentially benefit from aggressive treatment, and for patients with lesions that have not
responded to other laser treatments. The faser is also indicated for the reduction of red
pigmentation and hypertrophic and keloid scars where vascularity is an integral part of the scar.
Treatment of wrinkles.

Il. Description
I'he Fotona XP Plus Nd:YAG Family of Laser Systems is a flashlamp-excited, Nd:YAG
(Neodymium-doped Yttrium Aluminum Garnet) laser. Pulsed laser energy at a nominal
wavelength of 1064 nanometers (nm) is used. This wavelength causes maximum energy
absorption by the target (hair or Jesion) and minimum absorption by surrounding skin
. structures. In addition, the laser pulse duration is controlled to be equal to or shorter than
the relaxation time of the target, to minim ize heat transfer to surrounding tissues.
: Within the system, an optical cavity contains the Nd:YAG crystal, which is activated by
means of the use of flashlamps. After the cavity, a red diode aiming beam ts reflected :
onto a coaxial beam path using a beamsplitter assembly. The combined therapeutic and
aiming beams are guided down an optical fiber delivery system to a focusing handpiece.
The laser is used in non-contact mode. The Fotona XP Plus Nd:YAG Family of Laser
Systems is designed with 5 major sub-systems:
a) A high voltage power supply which converts and rectifies the a.c. mains current to
provide regulated power for the flashlamp simmer current and main triggering pulse.
b) A cooling system consisting of an internal water flow circuit together with water-toair heat exchanger. .
c) An Nd:YAG laser rod, capable of generating optical pulses .
d) An optical delivery system, interfacing the energy from the laser to the patient via an
optical fiber and focusing handpiece.
e) The microprocessor based controller which regulates the functions of the laser and
allows parameter selection by the user.

Ill. Summary of Substantial Equivalence

The Fotona XP Plus Nd:YAG Family of Laser Systems shares the same genera!
indications for use, operating principles, mechanism of action, technological features as
the predicate devices Candela GentleYAG Family of Laser Systems (K033172), Family

of Altus Medical CoolGlide Aesthetic Lasers (K023954, KQ22226) and Fotona Dualis

XP Plus (K002839) and therefore is substantially equivalent to the predicate devices.

Technologically, the predicate devices have similar characteristics to the Fotona XP Plus
Nd:YAG Family of Laser Systems . All systems comprise a flashlamp pumped Nd:YAG
laser rod generating light at a wavelength of 1064 nm, which is subsequently delivered to
the patient via an optical fiber delivery system and focusing handpiece.
‘The risk and benefits for the Fotona XP Plus Nd:YAG Family of Laser Systems are
comparable to the predicate devices when used for similar clinical applications.
The Fotona XP Plus Nd:YAG Family of Laser Systems shares the same design features
(wavelength, active medium, cooling system, power supply, beam deliveries, controls,
housing) as the predicate devices. The output characteristics are the same as those of the
predicate devices.
All lasers utilize class I aiming beams which pose no hazard to the user.
All systems are microprocessor controlled devices. The microprocessor control regulates
normal operation, permits parameter selection and avoids hazard incidence.
All systems utilize an internal closed loop water-air heat exchanger circuit for optimal
thermal control of the faser cavity.

/ The risk and benefits for the Fotona XP Plus Nd:YAG Family of Laser Systems system
are identical to the predicate devices when used for similar clinical applications.
It is therefore believed that there are no new questions of Safety or Effectiveness raised
by the introduction of this device.
As the Fotona XP Plus Nd:YAG Family of Laser Systems is substantially equivalent
with respect to indication for use, output characteristics, materials, method of operation,
and physical construction to the predicate devices, we believe it clearly meets the
requirements for substantial equivalence according to Section 510(k) guidelines. Safety
and effectiveness are reasonably assured, therefore justifying 510(k) clearance for .
commercial sale. : .
