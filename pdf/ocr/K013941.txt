Pulsion™ FS Laser Premarket Notification
The Pulsion FS Laser is a precision ophthalmic surgical laser designed for use in
performing lamellar corneal resections. The cutting action of the PULSION FS Laser is
achieved through precise individual micro-photodisruptions of tissue, created by tightly
focused ultrashort pulses which are delivered through a disposable applanation lens while
fixating the eye under very low vacuum.

5. Statement of intended use:
The Pulsion™ FS is an ophthalmic surgical laser indicated for use in the creation of a
corneal flap in patients undergoing LASIK surgery or other treatment requiring initial
lamellar resection of the cornea.

6. Statement of how the technological characteristics of the device compare to those of
the predicate or legally marketed device.
The technological characteristics of the Pulsion FS Laser have already been cleared under
K993153 for lamellar corneal resections. The design, materials, and characteristics of the
laser keratome are the same irrespective of the indication for use.

7. Brief summary of nonclinical tests and results:
The Pulsion FS Laser has undergone testing and is in compliance with applicable safety
standards. In addition, the Pulsion FS was found to perform equivalently to the predicate
laser keratome, with respect to the creation of corneal resections in extensive ex vivo and
in vivo studies. Thus, the Pulsion FS Laser and the predicate device have similar safety,
effectiveness or performance profiles.

Dear Dr. Gordon:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications .
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
