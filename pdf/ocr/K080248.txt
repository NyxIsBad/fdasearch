2. Names
Device Name: Spectra VRMIII Laser System
Classification Name: Laser Instrument, Surgical, Powered
Product Code: GEX
Panel: General & Plastic Surgery
3. Predicate Devices
The Spectra VRMIILI Laser System is substantially equivalent to the Lutronic
Corporation Spectra VRMII Q-Switched Nd:YAG Laser System, the HOYA
ConBio Med ite C6 Laser System and the RevLite Laser System.
4. Device Description
The Spectra VRMIII Laser System produces a pulsed beam of coherent near
infrared (1064 nm) and visible (532nm) light. This beam is directed to the
treatment zone by means of an articulated arm coupled to a handpiece. In
addition, two dye handpieces are available that convert the 532 nm wavelength to
585 nm and 650 nm.

When the beam contacts human tissue, the energy in the beam is absorbed,
resulting in a very rapid, highly localized temperature increase to the target
chromospheres such as melanin and tattoo particles. This increases localized
temperature of the chromospheres. The instantaneous temperature increase causes
fragmentation of the chromospheres to smaller particles.
By directing the beam onto specific tissue locations, using different handpieces,
and controlling the treatment fluence, the intensity of the temperature of the target
can be varied. The physician can optimize the cffect for different applications by
controlling the energy of the laser pulse and the spot size of the treatment beam.
5. Indications for Use
The Spectra VRMIII Laser System is indicated for the incision, excision, ablation,
vaporization of soft tissues for general dermatology, dermatologic and general
surgical procedures for coagulation and hemostasis.

Dear Ms. O’Connell:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050,
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
"contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at

(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474, For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464, You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance
at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address
