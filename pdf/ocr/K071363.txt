Device Description:
The Waterlase®/Waterlase*MD dental laser system is a device used to perform a
variety of dental soft and hard tissue indications. For hard tissue procedures the
Waterlase®!Waterlase*MD uses the Erbium, Chromium: Yttrium, Scandium, Gallium
Garnet (Er,Cr:YSGG) laser in combination with advanced water atomization spray
technology to cut, remove, shave, contour, roughen and etch tissues. Soft tissue
procedures are performed using a different mode of operation where direct
Er,Cr:YSGG laser energy is applied to incise, excise or ablate these tissues. For soft
tissue procedures the water spray is applied for hydration, cooling or to keep tissues
and the field of view clean. For hard tissue applications the spray is part of the tissue
removing process as well as hydration, cooling and keeping tissues and field of view
clean.

A flexible fiberoptic terminated into the handpiece delivers the
Waterlase®/Waterlase®MD laser energy to the end fiber tip and target. A visible
aiming light emitted from the handpiece’s distal end pinpoints the area of treatment.
Three fiber optic ports provide illumination from the handpiece to the tissue site in
addition to the center beam emitting source. In both hard and soft tissue applications
the power output, pulse duration, repetition rate (frequency) and air and water flow
rates are adjustable to specific user requirements. The spot size and spot geometry can
also be varied by changing tips which include different diameters and end
configurations.
Indications for Use:
Root Canal Disinfection
Laser root canal disinfection after endodontic instrumentation
Contraindications:
All clinical procedures performed with Waterlase®/Waterlase®MD must be subject to
the same clinical judgment and care as with traditional techniques. Patient risk must
always be considered and fully understood before clinical treatment. The clinician
must completely understand the patient's medical history prior to treatment. Exercise
caution for general medical conditions, which might contraindicate a local procedure.
Such conditions may include, but are not limited to, allergy to local or topical
anesthetics, heart disease, lung disease, bleeding disorders, sleep apnea or an immune
system deficiency. Medical clearance from patient's physician is advisable when
doubt exists regarding treatment.
Substantial Equivalence:
The purpose of the 510(k) is to expand the Waterlase®, and Waterlase@MD
indications for use to include root canal disinfection, an indication that has
already been cleared by the FDA for equivalent medical devices. The
Waterlase®, and Waterlase@MD have already been cleared by the FDA for
indications which relate to root canal procedures and surgical endodontic .
procedures related to root end amputation. Other indications cleared for
this device include cavity preparations class I, II, HI, IV and V, cutting, shaving,
contouring and resection of osseous tissue, osteotomy, hard tissue roughening or
etching, enameloplasty, soft tissue procedures and periodontal procedures related to
surgery and the periodontal pocket. The Waterlase®, and Waterlase@MD indications
enumerated above have been cleared by the FDA as part of the 510(k) submissions
K031140, K013908, K030523, K022803, KO11041, K012511, K990908, and
K990219. For the indication on root canal disinfection requested with this submission,
the Waterlase®, and Waterlase®MD are equivalent to the following products:
BIOPURE MTAD Root Canal Cleanser K053167, and EndoPure Root Canal Cleanser
K032361. Comparison between Waterlase®, and Waterlase®MD and the predicate
devices is included in Table 1. Based on the comparison, the Waterlase®, and
Waterlase@MD are substantially equivalent in relation to previous clearances.

Equivalency was further substantiated through performance data, including in-vitro
evaluation of anti-microbial efficacy of the

Er,Cr:YSGG (Waterlase®) and the evaluation of the temperature rise which related to

the safety of these devices during root canal disinfection. Copies of the study reports

are included under section 8, titled Performance Data.

Dear Ioana Rizoiu:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

Page 2 — Ioana Rizoiu
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance
at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address
