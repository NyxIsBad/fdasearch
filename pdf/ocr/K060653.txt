material and delivers a short duration thermal pulse that heats the area being treated. The
device is powered by two AA alkaline batteries.
Indications for Use:
ThermaClear™ is indicated for the treatment of individual acne pimples in persons with
mild to moderate inflammatory acne.
Performance Data:
Non-clinical and clinical performance testing was conducted with the ThermaClear™
device.

Preclinical Testing

ThermaClear™ was tested for EMI in accordance with the IEC 60601-1 standard.

ThermaClear™ operates within the EMI emission, susceptibility and static

discharge levels specified in the IEC 60601-1 standard.

Clinical Testing

Clinical testing was conducted in both a controlled practitioner office

environment and a consumer home-use environment and submitted as part of the

510(k) application to confirm that ThermaClear™ is as safe and effective as the

predicate device. The controlled clinical study design was a randomized, blinded

study.
Substantial Equivalence:
ThermaClear™ and its predicate devices are all devices that use either heat or light to
treat the dermatological condition of mild to moderate acne by exposing the surface of
the skin to a precise energy fluence. The delivered energy heats the skin to accelerate

resolution of the acne lesion with no risk of burns. The minor differences in the
technological characteristics of ThermaClear™ and its predicate devices do not raise any
new issues of safety or efficacy. Thus, ThermaClear™ is substantially equivalent to the
predicate device for treatment of mild to moderate acne.
Conclusion:
Based on the indications for use, technological characteristics, performance testing and
comparison to predicate devices, the proposed device has been shown to be safe and
effective for its intended use.

therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good
manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class IH] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may

or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply
with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part
807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the
quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product
radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
