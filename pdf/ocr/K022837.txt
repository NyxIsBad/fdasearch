II. Description
The Fotona Tandem laser system is based on the Nd:YAG (1064 nm) and KTP (532 nm)
laser technology. There are two optical cavities containing the Nd:YAG and KTP
crystals. Both are activated by means of the use of flashlamps. After each cavity, a red
diode aiming beam is reflected onto a coaxial beam path using a beamsplitter assembly.
The combined therapeutic and aiming beams are guided through the optical fiber delivery
systems to the focusing handpieces.
Both lasers are used in non-contact mode.
Both laser heads share a common power supply, control system, and cooling system. The
internal computer can be directed to select either the Nd:YAG head or the KTP (inixedwavelength 1064/532 nm) head. When the laser is first turned on the physician is able to
select the desired wavelength via control panel.
III. Intended Use
The Fotona Tandem Laser System and Accessories is intended for incision, ablation,
vaporization, coagulation, and hemostasis of vascular lesions and soft tissue in various
surgical areas, and for permanent hair reduction in Fitzpatrick skin types I-VI.

IV. Summary of Substantial Equivalence
Fotona believes that its Tandem laser system is substantially equivalent to the Fotona
Dualis’” long pulse KTP laser system previously cleared for incision, ablation,
vaporization, coagulation, and hemostasis of vascular lesions and soft tissue in various .
surgical areas, to the Fotona Dualis‘? Nd:YAG laser system previously cleared also for
permanent hair reduction in Fitzpatrick skin types I — VI, and to the Palomar Clear Light
Nd:YAG laser system, marketed under Palomar Q-YAG 5. Similar as the Fotona
Tandem, the Palomar system incorporates dual wavelengths (1064 and 1064/532 nm) and
has been cleared for treatment of vascular lesions and removal of hair.
They therefore have the same Intended Use as the Fotona Tandem laser system.
The Tandem laser system shares the same design features (wavelength, active medium,
cooling system, power supply, beam deliveries, controls, housing) as the Fotona Dualis’?
and the Fotona Dualis*?.
The risk and benefits for the Tandem laser system are comparable to the predicate
devices when used for similar clinical applications.
It is therefore believed that there are no new questions of Safety or Effectiveness raised
by the introduction of the Tandem laser system.

Dear Sir or Madam:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for
use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce
prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good
manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply
with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part
807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the

/ ' . Page 2 — Sir or Madam : . : ,
quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable; the electronic product .
- radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050. ° co
-__ This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
0 _ marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
. to proceed to the market. , .

If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Additionally, for questions on the promotion

Nd:YAG Laser (1064 nm)

The Tandem Nd:YAG laser systems is indicated for use in surgical and aesthetic applications

requiring selective photothermolysis of target chromophores in soft tissue in the meciical

specialities of general and plastic surgery and dermatology:

. To effect stable long-term, or permanent, hair reduction in skin types | - VI through selective
targeting of melanin in hair follicles. Permanent hair reduction is defined as a long-term
stable reduction in the number of hairs regrowing after a treatment regimen.

° For removal of unwanted hair.

° For coagulation and hemostasis of vascular lesions.
