4. DEVICE DESCRIPTION
The XTRAC XL? Excimer Laser System Model AL8000 is a complete sel f-contained
compact UVB laser light source, which utilizes a XeC]l gas mixture to generate an
operator selected dose and target-specific ultraviolet light at monochromatic
wavelength of 308 nm. The laser system consists of a touch-screen display, an
advanced fiberoptic cable attached to a handpiece, and a foot-switch to initiate
exposure. The laser is enclosed in a protective interlocked housing. The unit is
designed to operate on standard AC power available from wall outlets and can
accommodate US, European and other nominal supply voltages and operating
frequencies.
5. INTENDED USE
The intended use is targeted UVB phototherapy for treatment of the skin conditions
including psoriasis, vitiligo, atopic dermatitis, and leukoderma.
6. SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE
The application of the Excimer Laser phototherapy has been proven to be
substantially equivalent to current legally marketed devices in the treatment of
indications previously cleared by CDRH (ODE). PhotoMedex has been granted
clearance via K992914, K003705, K011382, K020847, and K031451 for this method
of phototherapy generation.
The intended use for the PhotoMedex XTRAC XL? Excimer Laser System, Model
AL8000, and the identified predicate devices are identical in that they are all excimer
lasers used to produce monochromatic (308nm) UVB light for the purpose of
targeted, dose controlled UVB (dermatological) phototherapy. The differences
between the XTRAC XL? Excimer Laser System Model AL8000, and the identified
predicates are limited to a reduction in product size and weight, improved ergonomics
for the user, enhanced operating parameters, and additional minor internal
improvements to reduce (required) maintenance costs. We believe the inclusion of
these features does not affect the device’s safety or intended use as compared to the
identified predicates.
7. CLINICAL PERFORMANCE TESTING
All clinical indications requested in this application have been previously cleared in
the identified predicate devices. The XTRAC XL? Excimer Laser System Model
AL8000 does not introduce any new indications for use, and will perform in an
identical manner as the identified predicates, therefore PhotoMedex believes
duplicative clinical data is not required as a condition of granting market clearance
for the XTRAC XL? Excimer Laser System Model AL8000.

8. PRODUCT PERFORMANCE TESTING
Testing and certification relevant to the XTRAC XL? Excimer Laser System Model
AL8000 includes conformance to current applicable international EN 60601 series of
standards, 21 CFR Part 1040.10 & 1040.11 Performance Standards for LightEmitting Products and also includes UL 2601-1/UL60601-1 Medical Electrical
Equipment classified device. Products are produced and distributed within a facility
that has been registered by FDA to manufacture medical devices. The XTRAC XL?
Excimer Laser System Model AL8000 also is reviewed for risk management utilizing
EN ISO 1497, Application of risk management to medical devices ensuring all aspects
of the device are reviewed for potential hazards.
9, CONCLUSIONS
PhotoMedex believes the XTRAC XL? Excimer Laser System Model AL8000 is
substantially equivalent to the identified predicates in that it does not introduce any
new issues of safety or efficiency as compared to the predicates. The Indications for
use, methods of operation and power source is identical to the predicate.

Dear Mr. Rose:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class [II (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000- 1050.

Page 2 - Mr. Bob Rose
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
