Device Name: QuadroStar 980

Common Name: QuadroStar 980

Classification Name: Instrument, surgical, powered, laser
79-GEX
21 CFR 878.481

Equivalent Device: Ceralas D 980 :

Device Description: The QuadroStar 980 is a diode laser system emitting a laser
beam at a wavelength of 980 nm with a maximum power
of 25 W.

Intended Use: Delivery of laser light to soft tissue in the contact or noncontact mode during surgical procedures, including via
endoscopes, introducers or catheters. The QuadroStar 980 is
generally indicated for incision, excision, vaporization,
ablation, hemostasis or coagulation of soft tissue in ear,
nose and throat and oral surgery (otolaryngology), dental
procedures, arthroscopy, gastroenterology, general surgery,
dermatology, plastic surgery, podiatry, urology, gynecology,
neurosurgery (peripheral nervous system), pulmonary
surgery cardiothoracic surgery. This QuadroStar 980 is

specifically indicated for hemostasis and coagulation of soft
tissue (including cardiac tissue).

Comparison to: The QuadroStar 980 Laser System is substantially equivalent
to the Ceralas D 980 Laser System, with the same principles
of operation, the same wavelength and essentially the same
power range as the predicate device for the same
indications for uses.

Nonclinical Performance Data: None

Clinical Performance Data: None

Conclusion: The QuadroStar 980 Laser System is another safe and
effective device for delivery of laser light to soft tissue in the
contact or non-contact mode during surgical procedures,
including via endoscopes, introducers or catheters. The
QuadroStar 980 is generally indicated for incision, excision,
vaporization, ablation, hemostasis or coagulation of soft
tissue in ear, nose and throat and oral surgery
(otolaryngology), dental procedures, arthroscopy,
gastroenterology, general surgery, dermatology, plastic
surgery, podiatry, urology, gynecology, neurosurgery
(peripheral nervous system), pulmonary surgery
cardiothoracic surgery. This QuadroStar 980 is specifically
indicated for hemostasis and coagulation of soft tissue
(including cardiac tissue). ;

Dear Mr. Thieme:
This letter corrects our substantially equivalent letter of March 20, 2006.
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices,
good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA),
it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be
found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Page 2 - Mr. Reinhard Thieme
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to continue marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your
device to proceed to the market.
’ If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0120. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
