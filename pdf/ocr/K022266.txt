510(k) SUMMARY OF SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS
SYNERON MEDICAL Ltd. AURORA SR
This summary of safety and effectiveness information is being submitted in
accordance with the requirements of the SMDA 1990 and 21 CFR 807.92.
Submitter: Syneron Medical Ltd., Sultam Industrial park, P.O.B. 550,

Tel. +972-4-909-7424 ext. 7604, Fax +972-4-909-7417
Name of the Device: Aurora SR
Predicate Devices: The Aurora SR is substantially equivalent to a combination of
the following devices: the PhotoDerm VL, manufactured by
ESC Medical Systems Ltd. and subject of K950493; the
PhotoDerm PL, manufactured by ESC Medical Systems Ltd.
and subject of K960772; the ThermaCool, manufactured by
Thermage Inc. and subject of K000944; the Vnus Closure
System, manufactured by Vnus Medical Technologies Inc. and
subject of K982816.
Device Description: The Aurora SR is a device that is used for treatment of
superficial, benign vascular and pigmented lesions. The Aurora
SR treatment is based on the principle of selective
(electromagnetic) thermolysis. According to this principle,
parameters of optical and RF energy (spectrum, exposure
duration and energy density) are chosen and optimized to
selectively damage pigmented and vascular lesions without
damaging the surrounding tissues.
The Aurora SR is intended for use in dermatology for treatment of superficial benign
vascular and pigmented lesion treatment.
Based upon an analysis of the overall performance characteristic for the device,
Syneron Medical Ltd. believes that no significant differences exit. Therefore the
Aurora DS should raise no new issues of safety or effectiveness.

Dear Dr. Waldman:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean

comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
