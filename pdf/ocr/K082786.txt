2. Device Name:
Trade Name: PEAK Surgery System, consisting of:
PULSAR™ Generator and
PEAK PlasmaBlade™ Tissue Dissection Devices
Common Name: Electrosurgical Device and Accessories
Classification Name: Electrosurgical Cutting and Coagulation Device and
Accessories (21 CFR 878.4400)
3. Predicate Devices:
PULSAR Generator and PEAK PlasmaBlade Tissue Dissection Device
(K073057)
Ellman Surgi-Max Generator (K061174)
. ELECTROMEDICS FAS-CLEAN electrode (K073616)
4, Device description:
The PEAK Surgery System consists of the PULSAR Generator, PEAK
PlasmaBlade Tissue Dissection Devices, and an optional wireless foot pedal. The
PULSAR Generator is a microcontroller based, isolated output, electrosurgical
unit that has been designed to produce monopolar and bipolar RF energy for
cutting and coagulation during surgery. The PULSAR Generator is used with the
PEAK PlasmaBlade Tissue Dissection Devices, which are single use, sterile
handpieces for monopolar energy delivery. The PEAK PlasmaBlade Tissue
Dissection Devices consists of an insulated blade electrode, rotating bendable
shaft, handle with integrated controls, and a cable. An optional footswitch may be
used to operate the system in lieu of the controls on the PlasmaBlade handpieces.

5. Intended Use: fs a 4
The PEAK Surgery System is indicated for cutting and coagulation of soft tissue
during General, Plastic and Reconstructive (including but not limited to skin
incisions and development of skin flaps), ENT, Gynecologic, Orthopaedic,
Arthroscopic, Spinal and Neurological surgical procedures.
6. Technological Characteristics:
The PEAK Surgery System is similar to the predicate devices in that they are all
electrosurgical instruments used to cut tissue and coagulate sofi tissue, utilizing
RF powered distal ends.
7. Performance Data:
Preclinical laboratory and performance tests were executed to ensure the devices
functioned as intended and met design specifications. Sufficient data were
obtained to show that the device is substantially equivalent to the predicate
devices, and meets safety and effectiveness criteria.
8. Sterilization:
The PEAK PlasmaBlade Tissue Dissection Devices are provided sterile. The
device is not intended for reuse or resterilization.
9. Conclusions:
By virtue of design, materials, function, and intended use, the PEAK Surgery
System is substantially equivalent to FDA-cleared devices currently marketed in
the United States. In establishing substantial equivalence to the predicate devices,
PEAK Surgical evaluated the indications for use, materials incorporated, product
specification and energy requirements of those systems.

Dear Dr, Carlson:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated'in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate :
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
‘You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration. . ,
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
. that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act .
_ orany Federal statutes and regulations administered hy other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

Page 2 — Grace A. Carlson, MD ;
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market. .
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at :
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket .
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
