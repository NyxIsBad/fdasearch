(of the Summary)
Device Name: Viridis Twin Ophthalmic Photocoagulator
Common Name: Ophthalmic Laser, frequency doubled Nd:YAG (532 nm) laser
Laser Surgical Instrument, frequency doubled Nd: YAG (532 nm) laser
Ophthalmic Laser, 810 nm diode laser
Laser Surgical Instrument; 810 nm diode laser
Classification Ophthalmic laser (see 21 CFR 886.4390)
Name: Laser surgical instrument (see: 21 CFR 878.4810).
Product Code: HQF; Panel: 86
Product Code: GEX; Panel: 79
Predicate devices: Viridis Laser (K960867); Novus Verdi Delivery Systems (K991258) -and
the Viridis laser

IRIS Medical OcuLight SL/SLx (K020374); Nidek DC-3300 (K013760)

The predicate lasers utilize several delivery systems, including slit lamp adapters,
biomicroscopes, endoprobes, and indirect ophthalmoscopes to deliver the laser
energy to the treatment sites.

The delivery systems used with the Viridis Twin Ophthalmic Photocoagulator are the
same as or similar to delivery systems supplied with or used with other ophthalmic
photocoagulators operating at 532 nm and/or 810 nm. These devices are
independently marketed by their respective manufacturers which are responsible for
complying with regulatory and marketing requirements. The cited models are
compatible for use with the Viridis Twin Ophthalmic Photocoagulator.

Device description: The Viridis Twin Ophthalmic Photocoagulator is a combination system consisting
of a Nd:YAG frequency doubled laser which emits a beam of coherent light at 532
nm and a diode laser which emits a beam of coherent light 810 microns. The
treatment beam is selected by the user, the delivery system is attached to the
appropriate laser aperture, and the energy is delivered to the treatment site(s) via
delivery systems/devices.

Indications: The Quantel Viridis Twin Ophthalmic Photocoagulator is indicated for the

photocoagulation or ablation of pigmented tissue within the eye.
The 532 nm wavelength is indicated for use for:
retinal photocoagulation
proliferative diabetic retinopathy,
macular degeneration, and
retinal detachment.
peripheral photocoagulation
proliferative diabetic retinopathy,
macular degeneration, and
retinal detachment.
endophotocoagulation (EPCP)
intraocular photocoagulation as an adjunct in vitrectomy surgery,
complicated rhegmatogeous,
tractional retinal detachments,
proliferative vitreoretinopathy,
proliferative diabetic retinopathy,
retinopathy, and
retinal vascular tumors.
The 810 nm wavelength is indicated for use for:
photocoagulation or ablation of pigmented tissue within the eye,
transscleral ciliary body ablation (treatment is reserved for patients with chronic glaucoma
and those not responding to conventional treatments),
limited and pan-retinal photocoagulation,
transpupillary photocoagulation,

endophotocoagulation,

treatment of complicated rhegmatogeous, tractional retinal detachments, proliferative
vitreoretinopathy, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, peripheral
photocoagulation (recumbent patients),

transpupillary photocoagulation of choriodal neovasculature, and

age-related macular degeneration (AMD) treatments.

Performance Data: None required.

CONCLUSION: Based on the information in this notification Quantel Medical concludes that the
Viridis Twin Ophthalmic Photocoagulator is substantially equivalent to the cited
legally marketed predicates. Information regarding delivery systems which may be
used with the laser is supplied by Quantel Medical; the individual devices or systems
are marketed by their respective manufacturers who have the responsibility for
complying with applicable regulations and marketing requirements.

Dear Mr. Barnes:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for
use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce
prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good
manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply
with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR
Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in

Page 2 — Mr. Roger W. Barnes
the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product
radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Additionally, for questions on the promotion
and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4639. Also,
please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR
Part 807.97): Other general information on your responsibilities under the Act may be obtained
from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free
number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address
