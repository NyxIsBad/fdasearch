& Summary Basis of Equivalence:
There are no unique applications, indications, material or specifications presented herein. Evidence
of equivalence has been demonstrated through:
e The SoftLase G2 intended use and indications for use were previously cleared by FDA for the
predicate devices.
* The technical characteristics of the SoftLase G2 are similar to those of the cleared SoftLase,
Aurora HL and Twilite lasers.
e Laser output values of the SoftLase G2 are well within previously cleared values of the predicate
dental laser systems as described.
¢ The predicate devices and other previously cleared laser systems with similar power outputs have
a proven safety and effectiveness in the treatment of the claimed indications.
e Safety and performance testing.
Therefore, the SoftLase G2 Surgical Diode Laser System is substantially equivalent to its predicate
devices cited above and raises now new safety and/or effectiveness issues. :
9. Predicate Device (legally marketed comparison device)
Zap Lasers, Inc. believes that the following surgical laser systems are substantially equivalent to
the SoftLase - Surgical Laser Diode System:
1. SOFTLASE (K003440, ZAP Lasers, Inc.); 2, AURORA HL (K992374, Premier Laser
Systems, Inc.) and 3. TWILITE (K003385, Biolase Technology, Inc.).

10. Device Description:
The laser diode assembly with fiber bundle, which contains 3 single diode lasers, each of 1.6
watt output power (Class I'V lasers) lasing at about 808 nm. Each diode laser is coupled directly
into a 200 um core optical fiber using a special positioner. The assembly also contains a 5-mw .
power - 650 nm pilot laser diode, which is coupled into the three core fibers. In the second
version of the device, a single 5 Watt laser diode is used. A special optical system is
implemented to focus its laser diode radiation into a delivery fiber. It allows an effective use of
300 um and 200 um fibers. In both versions, a visible light of pilot laser is used for aiming the tip
of the delivering fiber onto the tissue.
The laser diode power supply, with two controller PCBs supplies power to the diodes in DC or
pulsed mode.
The delivery fiber cables, consist of multi-mode, single core optical fibers available in 200, 300,
400 and 600 um diameters. The standard SMA 905 fiber connector terminates one end of the
delivery fiber, which is attached to the SMA union at the rear panel of the laser box. The other
end of the fiber is stripped of its protective jacket and is cleaved to provide laser radiation output.
The foot-switch, is a standard (UL-approved) commercial foot-switch/pedal that provides handsfree ON/OFF capabilities. This controls initiation/termination of laser power from the distal end
of the delivery fiber. Each SoftLase G2 laser system is provided with two safety goggles, one
fiber stripper and one sapphire wedge scribe for fiber cleaving.

Dear Dr. Goble:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and we have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the :
indications for use stated in the enclosure) to devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to
May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have
been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
(Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices,
good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
