i. Device Name
Proprietary: OmniPulse™ Mini, Model 2120
Common: Holmium:Yttrium Aluminum Garnet (Ho:YAG) Laser System .
Classification: Various Medical Lasers —_
UL. Predicate Device
The predicate devices for the OmniPulse™ Mini are the Trimedyne OmniPulse ™-MAX
and OmniPulse Jr.™ laser systems.
IV. Device Description sO
The OmniPulse™ Mini Laser System Model 2120 is a pulsed solid-state Holmium:YAG
: laser system is designed to deliver infrared laser energy with a wavelength of 2.1m
and a nominal pulse width of 350 microseconds. Menu driven control options allow the
operator to select the pulse energy, the pulse repetition rate or frequency, and one of .
three exposure modes (continuous, single burst or repetitive burst).
Vv. Intended Use ;
The OmniPulse™ Mini is designed for use in conjunction with Trimedyne’s various
arthroscopic handpieces and optical fiber delivery devices. As with the other cleared
Trimedyne Ho:YAG laser systems, applications for this laser system include superficial
incision, excision, resection, ablation, coagulation, hemostasis, and vaporization, with or
without an endoscope, in the following indications:
e« Genera! Surgery of Soft Tissues
e« Genitourinary Surgery/Urology ~
« Otorhinolanryngology (ENT) Surgery
e Gynecological Surgery
e Lithotripsy and Percutaneous Urinary Lithotripsy . :

« Percutaneous Cervical, Lumbar, and Thoracic Disc Decompression/Discectomy
e Therapeutic Dermatological, Therapeutic Plastic, and Aesthetic Surgical
Procedures
. ° Gastroenterological/Gastrointestinal Surgery
_ When used in conjunction with the Trimedyne Side Firing Needle with Vent Sheath
family of optical fiber delivery devices, this laser system may be used for interstitial
incision, excision, resection, ablation, coagulation, hemostasis, and vaporization in
multispecialty applications. ;
Vi. Technological Characteristics
The laser is driven by a flash lamp and emits one pulse of laser radiation each time the
flash lamp is fired. The laser pulse refers to the pulse waveform - each laser pulse
consists of large numbers of overlapping spikes that have a duration of about one
microsecond. These spikes compose the pulse waveform with nominal pulse duration
of 350 microseconds. Laser pulses are generated at the frequency chosen by the
operator. Pulse frequencies of 7, 10, 15 and 20 Hz are available.
In general, the operator may request pulse energies from 0.2 to 2.0 Joules. The range
of pulse energies available depends on the pulse frequency. Not all energies are
available at all pulse frequencies. The number of pulses emitted from the laser system can be controlled by the operator through the choice of one of three exposure modes.
Vil. Nonclinical Data
No nonclinical data was submitted in this Premarket Notification.
Vill. Clinical Data :
No clinical data was submitted in this Premarket Notification. .
“IX, Conclusions . .
All of the characteristics of the OmniPulse Mini fall with the previously cleared ranges for .
the predicate devices. Therefore, the OmniPulse Mini Model 2120 is substantially
equivalent to the Trimedyne OmniPulse™-MAX and OmniPulse Jr.™ laser systems.

Dear Ms. Drew:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
‘ or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
