Dear Ms. Timberlake:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for
use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce
prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good
manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply
with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part
807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the
quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product
radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CIR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other
general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
