V. Intended Use

© The GentleYAG Laser is intended for use in the treatment of facial wrinkles.
VI. Rationale for Substantial Equivalence
The Candela GentleY AG Laser shares the same indications for use, matches key design
aspects, including spot size, similar wavelength and/or the same maximum delivered
power as the predicate devices, and therefore are substantially equivalent to the currently
marketed Candela Long Pulse Nd: YAG Laser System (K010104) and the Laserscope
Lyra Surgical Laser System (K020021).
VII. Safety and Effectiveness Information
The new indications for use are based on the indications for use for the predicate laser
systems.
Technologically, the Candela GentleY AG Laser is identical to the previous predicate

. Candela Long Pulse Nd: YAG Laser (K010104), and the Laserscope Lyra Surgical
Laser System (K02002) therefore the risks and benefits for the GentleY AG Laser are
comparable to these predicate device (s).
We therefore believe that there are no new questions of safety or effectiveness raised by
the introduction of the device.
VIII. Conclusion
It is the opinion of Candela Corporation that the GentleY AG Laser System is
substantially equivalent to the predicate devices based on operating principles, materials,
mechanism of action, design, construction, methods of assembly and intended uses.

Dear Mr. McGrail:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require‘approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does no: mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing

(21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.

contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
