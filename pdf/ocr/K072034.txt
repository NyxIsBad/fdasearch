Model 30 is indicated for Surgical, Dermatological,
Dental and Endovascular applications.
Model 6 and Model 4 are indicated for Dental and
Surgical applications.
The Diode Laser Family is designed with 4 major
subsystems: (1) an external structure; (2) power
electronics; (3) display with control electronics, which
Technological controls the power electronics, the user interface and
Characteristics: the laser source temperature via a thermostat board;
and (4) the laser system with an opto-mechanical block
composed of the laser source, the Peltier cooling system
with dissipater and fans, the fiber launching system,
the red diode aiming beam, and the power calibration
system. The external accessories include separate
optical fibers and hand pieces for dental, dermatological
and surgical applications, or for endovascular
applications. The fiber is connected to the system
through an SMA 905 socket on the front panel. In
addition to the four subsystems, the Diode Laser Family
incorporates several safety features, including a remote
. interlock and a key switch..
The Quanta System Diode Medical Laser Family is as
safe and effective as the predicate devices. The Diode
Substantial Medical Laser Family has the same intended uses, and
Equivalence: similar indications for use, technological characteristics,
and principles of operation as the predicates. The minor
technological differences between the Diode Medical
Laser Family and its predicates raise no new issues of
safety or effectiveness. Thus, the Diode Medical Laser
Family is substantially equivalent.

Dear Mr. Job:
This letter corrects our substantially equivalent letter of September 20, 2007.
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices,
good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class IT (Special Controls) or class III (PMA),
it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be
found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies, You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to continue marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
