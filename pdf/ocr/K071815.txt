Device Description

The Noveon’™ (Model LS1100-01-0968) is a Class IV Laser Surgical Instrument for use in

General and Plastic Surgery and Dermatology. The device consists of the following components

and accessories:

1. Laser Source and Control Unit: Two Class IV laser diodes, each providing continuous-wave
laser light, one at the 870 nm and one at 930 nm wavelength. The power output of each laser
is selectable from 1W to 8W in 0.1 W increments. There are two touch sensitive screens to
control the optical power output of each laser and a separate emergency on/off button.

2. Foot Pedal Switch: turns the lasers on/off when the lasers are enabled.

3. Flexible Optical Fiber and End Piece: designed to be lightweight for holding the distal end of

the fiber comfortably in the hand to perform procedures.

Intended Use

The Noveon™ (Model LS1100-01-0968) delivers continuous wave laser light in the contact or

non-contact mode during surgical procedures of the skin, subcutaneous tissues and nasal

passages in dermatology, plastic surgery, podiatry and otolaryngology. The device is indicated
for use in applications requiring incision, excision, vaporization, hemostasis, or coagulation of
soft tissue.

Performance Data

Performance Standards

° The Noveon™ (Model LS1100-01-0968) complies with applicable performance standards
for light emitting products as outlined in 21 CFR 1040.10 and 21 CFR 1040.11.

e The device has been tested and verified by Intertek ET] Semko as conforming to 47 CFR
Part 15, Subpart B Unintentional Radiator Class A. Prior to introduction into the US
market, the device will be tested and verified to conform to the applicable voluntary
electrical equipment standards; IEC 60601-1, IEC 60601-1-1, and IEC 60601-1-2.

e The device also conforms to the standards for biocompatibility as given by Cytoxicity: ISO
10993-5, Sensitization: ISO 10993-10, and Irritation: ISO 10993-10.

Performance Testing

A surgical study with a live Yorkshire pig was conducted to test the capability of the Noveon™

(Model LS1100-01-0968) to perform incision, contact coagulation, non-contact coagulation,

debridement, curettage and excision. Results from this study demonstrate the device

satisfactorily performed these procedures when used by a medical professional. Importantly,
there were no adverse events that were noted during the performance of any of these
demonstrations. Altogether there were 130 passes of the laser made during this demonstration, of
which 127 were made in the contact mode: incision (5), contact coagulation (4), debridement

(19), curettage (31), and excision (68).

Using tissue samples of porcine skin, muscle, and liver we tested individual samples with

exposures to 940 nm, 930 nm, and 870 nm. In addition, we tested samples with 870 nm and 930

nm in three different optical power combinations. The testing included both contact and non
contact (free beam) mode. The testing was performed in triplicate. For each test the width and
depth of the zone of ablation, the zone of coagulation (necrosis) and the zone of total destruction
were recorded. These data substantiate that the difference in tissue effect was comparable to the

940 nm predicate device and any differences were not of clinical significance.

Substantial Equivalence

The Noveon™ (Model LS1100-01-0968) share the same indications for use, similar laser and

electronics design features, safety and functional features, and therefore are substantially

equivalent to the predicate devices listed above.

Safety and Effectiveness

The Noveon™ (Model LS1100-01-0968) is designed in accordance with both mandatory and

voluntary Standards ensuring it is both safe and effective for the medical procedures indicated

above. No new clinical indications are to be provided by the introduction of the device as
compared to the predicate devices, identified above, which have previously demonstrated clinical
effectiveness.

Dear Mr.Burtt:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 — Mr. Richard Burtt
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
