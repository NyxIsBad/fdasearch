E. Applicant Device Description

The Mega 2000 Soft Dual Cord is constructed of a layer of conductive material
strain-relieved with two sheets of urethane material, and sealed between two
asymmetric layers of a viscoelastic polymer. (The top layer of polymer is thinner
than the bottom layer.) The polymer is encapsulated by a layer of urethane film.
Two cables connect the conductive layer of the device to two DetachaCables™.
The DetachaCable(s) are connected to a standard monopolar electrosurgical unit
(ESU). The device cables are insulated and strain-relieved well inside the device
to prevent patient or user burns.
The device is large enough to extend at least the length and width of a typical
patient torso. Pad size is approximately 20” x 46” x 4”.
In use, this device will lay on an operating room table with the patient lying on
top, on the side labeled “patient side”.

F. Applicant Device Intended Use
The Mega 2000 Soft Dual Cord Patient Return Electrode Pad is to be used as a
general purpose return electrode for one or two electrosurgical generators and/or a
pressure reduction pad in any surgical application. Electrosurgical use is restricted
to use with isolated monopolar electrosurgical generators.

G. Technological Characteristics
The technological characteristics of the proposed device are similar to the
predicate device. The only difference is the addition of a second cord for
connection to two different electrosurgical units at the same time during a
procedure. Other technological characteristics (capacitive coupling and pressure
reduction) are identical to the predicate device.

H. Safety Information
The only current flow from the patient to the Mega2000 Soft Dual Cord Patient
Return Electrode Pad is via capacitive coupling. This device is designed to be
current limiting (<100 mA/cm’) so as to prevent the patient from getting return
electrode site burns. This current limiting attribute is achieved by selecting
materials with high impedance per area.
The large contact area between the electrode and the patient lowers the total
impedance when there is substantial patient / pad contact area, and allows for
enough current flow for electrosurgery to be performed at the surgical site(s).
Prior to release of the device for distribution, Megadyne conducted extensive
testing of the device to assure its conformance to the voluntary standard ANSI /

a KozlZ26® ds¢3
AAMI HF 18-2001, Electrosurgical Devices. The clauses of the standard which
apply to capacitively-coupled return electrodes are:
Maximum Safe Temperature Rise:
Maximum Safe Temperature Rise was demonstrated, using the method specified
by the standard, with human volunteers and two electrosurgical generators. The
device is well within the requirements of the standard. (Ref. Appendix A.)
Electrode Contact Impedance:
Conformance with the minimum capacitance requirement was demonstrated
through bench testing. Device capacitance was evaluated under several different
test setups intended to simulate clinical use. (Ref. Appendix B.)
Both proposed and predicate device performed similarly during the above testing.
This device conforms to the applicable sections of AAMI HF-18/2001, under test
conditions. However, as with the predicate device, field conformance is affected
by clinical set-up which is beyond Megadyne’s control.

ABSTRACT
Mega2000® Soft Dual Cord reusable return electrodes were tested per the
requirements of protocol X1150075-10 revision 3. This testing was performed to
ensure compliance with the requirements in ANSI/AAMI HF-18, paragraph
4.2.3.1. An infrared camera was used to record the temperature changes. The
samples were tested in accordance with the IFU, specifically with no linen
between the pad and the patient and with a single linen layer between the pad and
the patient. The results show that the requirements of ANSI/AAMI HF-18,

Dear Ms. Magneson:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class JI (Special Controls) or class [II (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); Jabeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 - Ms. Ronda K. Magneson
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Additionally, for questions on the
