Date Summary Prepared: March 25, 2005

Device Trade Name: Cynergy Multiplex Laser

Common Name: Medical Laser System

Classification Name: Instrument, surgical, powered, laser
79-GEX
21 CFR 878.48

Equivalent Device: Cynosure Cynergy laser

Device Description: The Cynergy Multiplex laser is user selectable, multi wavelength laser,
having both an organic dye and an Nd:YAG rod lasing medium. It is a
pulsed dye laser with wavelengths of 585, 590, 595, 600 nm and an
Nd:YAG laser with a wavelength of 1,064 nm. It is capable of
delivering one wavelength pulse or mixing of two wavelengths pulse.
Laser activation is by footswitch. Overall weight of the laser is 285lbs,
and the size is 44”x19"x24” (HxWxD).

Electrical requirement is 110 VAC or 220 VAC, 20A, 50-60 Hz, single
phase.

Intended Use: The Cynergy Mulitplex is indicated for treatment of vascular lesions,
pigmented lesions, tattoos, wrinkles and hair removal.

Comparison: The Cynergy Multiplex laser is substantially equivalent to the predicate
laser with the same principle of operation, and similar wavelengths and
fluence ranges as the predicate devices.

Nonclinical Performance Data: none

Clinical Performance Data: none

Conclusion: The Cynergy Multiplex laser is another safe and effective device for
treating vascular lesions, pigmented lesions, tattoos, wrinkles and hair
removal.

Additional Information: none

Dear Mr. Cho:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is ‘substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class I (Special Controls) or class III (PMA),
it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device
can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA
may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CER Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 — Mr. George Cho This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your
device to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
