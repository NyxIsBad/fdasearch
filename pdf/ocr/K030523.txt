Device Description:
The Waterlase® hydrokinetic dental laser system is a diverse device utilized to
perform a variety of dental applications. For hard tissue procedures the
Waterlase® uses the Erbium, Chromium: Yttrium, Scandium, Gallium Gamet
(Er,Cr:YSGG) laser in combination with advanced water atomization technology
to cut, remove, roughen and etch tissues. Soft tissue procedures are performed
using a different mode of operation where direct Er,Cr:YSGG laser energy is
applied to incise, excise or ablate these tissues. In soft tissue procedures the water
spray is applied for hydration, cooling or to keep tissues clean. For hard tissue
applications the spray is part of the tissue removing process as well as hydration,
cooling and keeping the tissues clean.
A flexible fiberoptic handpiece delivers the Waterlase® laser energy. A visible
light emitted from the handpiece distal end pinpoints the area of treatment. In both
hard and soft tissue applications the power output, pulse energy, repetition rate
and air and water flow rates are adjustable to specific user requirements.

Cautions and Contraindications:
All clinical procedures performed with Waterlase® must be subjected to the same
clinical judgment and care as with traditional techniques. Patient risk must always

be considered and fully understood before clinical treatment. The clinician must
completely understand the patient's medical history prior to treatment. Exercise
caution for general medical conditions that might contraindicate a local procedure.
Such conditions may include allergy to local or topical anesthetics, heart disease,
lung disease, bleeding disorders, sleep apnea or an immune system deficiency.
Medical clearance from patient's physician is advisable when doubt exists
regarding treatment.
Substantial Equivalence:
‘There are no unique applications, indications, materials or specifications presented
herein. All the presented indications for use retain the same meaning as their
equivalent indications cleared by the FDA in K011041 (Watertase®, expanded
soft tissue indications including Sulcular Debridement), K012511 (Waterlase®,
indications for Root Canal), K013908 (Waterlase®, indications for oral osseous
procedures) and K022803 (Waterlase®, indications for Endodontic Surgery).
Conclusion:
The indications included herein are the same as those included in previous
clearances, Waterlase® is therefore substantially equivalent in relation to the
previous clearances.
