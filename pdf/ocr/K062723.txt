Intended Use / Indications for Use

The HALO Coagulation System intended use is for the coagulation of bleeding
and non-bleeding sites in the gastrointestinal tract.

The HALO® Coagulation System is indicated for use in the coagulation of bleeding
and non-bleeding sites in the gastrointestinal tract including but not limited to, the
esophagus. Indications include Esophageal Ulcers, Mallory-Weiss tears,
Arteriovenous Malformations, Angiomata, Barrett’s Esophagus, Dieulafoy Lesions,
and Angiodysplasia.

Technological Characteristics

The HALO®® Coagulation System consists of the HALO% Coagulation Generator
with a disposable single-use HALO Coagulation Catheter model 90-9100, output
cable, and an optional footswitch. The HALO Coagulation System performance
and mode of operation is substantially equivalent to the already cleared HALO”
Coagulation System (with catheter model 1520F).

Substantial Equivalence

The HALO Coagulation Catheter model 90-9100 and the predicate devices:
HALO® Coagulation Catheter model 1520F, have the same intended use,
indications for use, technological characteristics, and principles of operation. The
technological differences between the HALO” Coagulation Catheter and the
predicate device are: (1) The surface electrode was reduced from 15 x 20 mm to 13 x
20 mm to allow a smaller profile of the distal end; (2) The length of the catheter
shaft was increased from 105 cm to 160 cm for ergonomic issues and to allow the
use with a wider range of endoscopes; (3) The catheter maximum profile was
reduced from 17.5 mm to 13.5 mm. (4) Changes in materials.
All these differences were evaluated on bench and did not raise questions regarding
safety and efficacy. Thus the devices are equivalent.

Dear Ms. Filimon:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for
use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce
prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good
manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class I] (Special Controls) or class III (Premarket
Approval), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your
device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA
may publish further announcements concerning your device in the lederal Register.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
