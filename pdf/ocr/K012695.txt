Contra- Use of this device is contraindicated for:
indications ¢ non-arthroscopic surgical procedures,
e arthroscopic procedures during which a conductive irrigant is not used,
* patients for whom arthroscopy is contraindicated, and
e patients with pacemakers or other electronic device implants.

Device The arthroscopic wand electrode is bipolar electrosurgical probe comprised of
Description a shaft with an electrode array at its distal end and a connector at its proximal
end for coupling the electrode array to a high frequency power supply. The
electrode array has at least one active electrode and at least one return
electrode. Return electrodes are electrically insulated from the active ones
and are spaced so as not to contact the tissue being treated. The spacing also
ensures that the electrical circuit is always completed by a surrounding
conductive fluid, and not simply arcing between electrodes. The electrode
number and configuration can vary in number and spacing, electrode material,
or angle of the distal tip.
In use, the probe is positioned in close proximity to a target site within an
electrically conducting liquid, such as an isotonic saline. The conducting
liquid provides a current path between the active electrode(s) and the return
electrode(s). When radio frequency voltage is applied between the active and
return electrodes, high voltage gradients in the distal boundary of the active
electrode(s) is sufficiently high to break down the tissue through molecular
dissociation or disintegration. The ablative process can be precisely
controlled to remove a layer of tissue as thin as a few cells.
Formation of an ionized layer or plasma does not occur when the electrodes
are activated with a lower voltage. In this case, electrical current passes
through the tissue creating a thermal zone for coagulation of blood vessels
and shrinkage of some collagenous tissues of the joints during arthroscopic
surgery.
Vanguard receives previously used arthroscopic wands from healthcare
facilities; cleans, refurbishes (replaces shaft insulation), inspects, tests,
repackages and sterilizes the devices; and returns them to the healthcare
facility.

510(k) Summary of Safety & Effectiveness, Continued

Technological © The Vanguard reprocessed arthroscopic wands are essentially identical to

Characteristics the currently marketed OEM wands. No changes are made to the currently
marketed device’s specifications (except for the insulation material) and they
possess the same technological characteristics. Biocompatibility and
performance/functional testing demonstrate that the devices are equivalent
and continue to be safe and effective for their intended use.

Test Data Sterilization and packaging validations, functional/performance, nd
biocompatibility testing demonstrate that the reprocessed devices perform as
intended and are safe and effective.

Conclusion Based on the information provided herein and the 510(k) “Substantial
Equivalence” Decision Making Process Chart, we conclude that the Vanguard
reprocessed arthroscopic wands are substantially equivalent to the predicate
devices under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.

Dear Dr. Sammon:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 — Mike Sammon, Ph.D. .
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market. :
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801 and
additionally 21 CFR Part 809.10 for in vitro diagnostic devices), please contact the Office of
Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Additionally, for questions on the promotion and advertising of
your device, please contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4639. Also, please note the
regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21 CFR Part 807.97).
Other general information on your responsibilities under the Act may be obtained from the
Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number
