Vv. Indications for Use
The family of Altus Medical CoolGlide Aesthetic Lasers are intended for use in the
medical specialties of general and plastic surgery, dermatology, endoscopic/laproscopic
general surgery, gastroenterology, gynecology, otorhinolaryngology (ENT),
neurosurgery, oculoplastics, orthopedics, pulmonary/thoracic surgery and urology for
surgical and aesthetic applications.
1064nm:
Dermatology:
The Altus Medical Aesthetic CoolGlide laser systems are intended for the
coagulation and hemostasis of benign vascular lesions such as, but not limited to,
port wine stains, hemangiomas, warts, telangiectasia, rosacea, venus lake, leg
veins, spider veins and poikiloderma of civatte; and treatment of benign cutaneous
lesions, such as warts, scars, striae, and psoriasis. The lasers are also intended for
the treatment of benign pigmented lesions such as, but not limited to, lentigos
(age spots), solar lentigos (sun spots), café au lait macules, seborrheic keratoses,
nevi, chloasma, verrucae, skin tags, keratoses, tattoos (significant reduction in the
intensity of black and/or blue/black tattoos) and plaques.
Additionally, the lasers are indicated for pigmented lesions to reduce lesion size,
for patients with lesions that would potentially benefit from aggressive treatment,
and for patients with lesions that have not responded to other laser treatments.
The CoolGlide lasers are also indicated for the treatment of wrinkles such as, but
not limited to, periocular and perioral wrinkles.
The CoolGlide lasers are also indicated for the removal of unwanted hair, for
stable long term, or permanent, hair reduction through selective targeting of
melanin in hair follicles, and for the treatment for pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB).
The lasers are also indicated for the reduction of red pigmentation in hypertrophic
and keloid scars where vascularity is an integral part of the scar.
The CoolGlide lasers are indicated for use on all skin types (Fitzpatrick I-V]),
including tanned skin.
The intended use of the integral cooling system in the Altus CoolGlide laser
handpiece is to provide cooling of the skin, for the reduction of pain during laser
treatment, to allow for the use of higher fluences for laser treatments such as hair
removal and vascular lesions, and to reduce the potential side effects of laser
treatments.

Surgical Applications:
The lasers are indicated for the incision/excision and cutting, ablation,
coagulation/hemostatis of soft tissue in the performance of surgical applications in
endoscopy/laproscopy, gastroenterology, general surgery, head and
neck/otorhinolaryngology (ENT), neurosurgery, oculoplastics, orthopedics,
plastic surgery, pulmonary/thoracic surgery, gynecology (e.g. menorrhagia) and
urology.
Indications for use (532mm):
For coagulation and hemostasis of vascular and cutaneous lesions in dermatology
including, but not limited to, the following general categories: vascular lesions
[angiomas, hemangiomas (port wine), telangiectasia (facial or extremities
telangiectasias, venous anomalies, leg veins)]; benign pigmented lesions (nevi,
lentigines, chloasma, café-au-lait, tattoos (red and green ink); verrucae; skin tags;
keratoses; plaques; cutaneous lesion treatment (hemostasis, color lightening,
blanching, flattening, reduction of lesion size).
VI. Rationale for Substantial Equivalence
The family of Altus Medical CoolGlide Aesthetic Lasers share the same general
indications for use, and therefore is substantially equivalent to the currently marketed
Altus Medical family of CoolGlide Aesthetic Nd:YAG Lasers (K991798, K991234,
K003202 and K014040), the NLite Pulsed Dye Laser, manufactured by ICN (K000811,
K014130, and K013461), the Vbeam and Clearbeam Pulsed Dye Lasers, manufactured
Candela (K013043 and K013748), the PhotoGenica Pulsed Dye Laser, manufactured by
Cynosure (K012806), the CoolTouch I and CoolTouch II Nd:YAG lasers, manufactured
by ICN (K014035 and K003715), the Smoothbeam Diode Laser, manufactured by
Candela (K013825), and the Lyra Surgical Laser System, manufactured by Laserscope
(K020021).
VII. Safety and Effectiveness Information
The new indications for_use in dermatology, endoscopic/laproscopic general surgery,
gastroenterology, general surgery, gynecology, otorhinolaryngology, neurosurgery,
oculoplastics, orthopedics, plastic surgery, pulmonary.thoracic surgery, and urology are
based upon the indications for use for predicate laser systems.
Technologically, the CoolGlide family of aesthetic lasers is identical to the previous
predicate CoolGlide family (K014040). Therefore the risks and benefits for the
CoolGlide laser family are comparable to the predicate devices.
We therefore believe that there are no questions of safety or effectiveness raised by the
introduction of this device.

VII. Conciusion
The family of Altus Medical CoolGlide Aesthetic Lasers were found to be substantially
equivalent to the currently marketed Altus Medical family of CoolGlide Aesthetic
Nd:YAG Lasers (K991798, K991234, K003202 and K014040), the NLite Pulsed Dye
Laser, manufactured by ICN (K000811, K014130, and K013461), the Vbeam and
Clearbeam Pulsed Dye Lasers, manufactured Candela (K013043 and K013748), the
PhotoGenica Pulsed Dye Laser, manufactured by Cynosure (K012806), the CoolTouch I
and CoolTouch II Nd:YAG lasers, manufactured by ICN (K014035 and K003715), the
Smoothbeam Diode Laser, manufactured by Candela (K013825), and the Lyra Surgical
Laser System, manufactured by Laserscope (K020021). The family of Altus Medical
CoolGlide Aesthetic Lasers share similar indications for use, design features, and similar
functional features as, and thus are substantially equivalent to, the currently marketed
predicate devices.
