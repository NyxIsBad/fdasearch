Description of The Profile Multi-Platform System is a modular, mutti-wavelength laser/light system
Profile Multi-Platform The system uses scanning and focusing optics to deliver a pattern of thermal
System energy to the treatment site. The system consists of control console which houses the
power supply, cooling system, fiber optic delivery system and/or articulated arm
delivery system with handpiece and/or scanner.
intended Use: 1064 nm Indications for Use:
The Profile Multi-Platform Systems and Accessories are intended for use in the
medical specialties of general and plastic surgery, dermatology,
endoscopicMaproscopic general surgery, gastroenterology, gynecolagy,
otorhinolaryngology (ENT), neurosurgery, oculoplastics, orthopedics,
pulmonary/thoracic surgery and uralogy for surgical and aesthetic applications.
Dermatology:
Coagulation and hemostasis of benign vascular lesions such as, but not limited to
port wine stains, hemangiomas, warts, telangiectasia, rosacea, venus lake, leg veins
and spider veins. The lasers are also intended for the treatment of benign pigmented
lesions such as, but not limited to, lentigos (age spots), solar lentigos (sun spats),
café au lait macules, seborrheic keratoses, nevi, chloasma, verrucae, skin tags,

© Reduce discomfort during and/or associated with tight or laser treatment,

* Minimize thermal injury, including thermal necrosis, to non-target skin and skin
structures during and/or associated with light or laser treatment. thus reducing
possible complications such as scabbing, scarring, hyper- and/or
hypopigmentation,

Allow the use of higher light or laser fluences for light or laser treatments (such as
for hair removal and the treatment of vascular or pigmented lesions), and

* Reduce potential side effects of light or laser treatments (such as for hair removal!
and the treatment of vascular or pigmented lesions)

Technological The Profile Multi-Platform System shares the same indications for use, similar design
Characteristics features (including wavelength, laseright medium and delivery systems, power

supply, cooling and control system), functional features (including power output,

repetition rate, energy, spot size and fluence), and is therefore substantially

equivalent to the above legally marketed predicate devices. 
Safety and The indications for use are based upon the indications for use for predicate systems.
