AtriCure Incorporated Bipolar Coagulation System 510({k)

Indication For Use Statement
The AtriCure Bipolar Coagulation System is intended to ablate and coagulate
soft tissue during General, ENT, Thoracic, Gynecology, and Urology surgical
procedures. ;

Product Description
The AtriCure Bipolar Coagulation System consists of two components: AtriCure
Bipolar Coagulator and AtriCure Bipolar Electrosurgical Generator.
The Bipolar Coagulator is substantially equivalent to the predicate Bipolar
Forceps in that each consists of a handle connected to a pair of grasping jaws
with electrodes on each jaw arm. All the devices utilize the same bipolar
Electrosurgical technology, i.e., radio frequency (RF) energy, to coagulate the
tissue by heating. The Bipolar Coagulator contains a negative and positive
electrode on opposite jaw arms. The function of the Bipolar Coagulator and
predicate devices is the same, current flows from a negatively charged pole
through the tissue to a positively charged pole. The Bipolar Coagulator is
provided as a sterile single patient use device and is provided in a variety of
shapes and sizes. The Bipolar Coagulator is constructed with standard
biocompatible materials used in medical devices involved in tissue contact.
The Bipolar Coagulator is designed to grasp tissue between the electrodes.
When the energy is applied, the tissue touching the electrodes is coagulated.
The field of coagulation extends up to 2 mm from the electrode. Area of
coagulated tissue will be up to 4 mm in width or up to 60 mm in length. Fully
coagulated tissue can be achieved for tissue thickness less than 10 mm.
The Electrosurgical Generator is set to deliver 750 mA of current. As tissue
coagulation proceeds the impedance increases. The voltage is set to not exceed
75 Volts. When a voltage of 75 Volts is reached, the impedance increases and
current flow decreases with voltage maintained at 75 Volts. Impedance of 400
ohms typically indicates fully coagulated tissue. The unit will display impedance,
current, voltage, and power on the front of the generator. The unit will also
monitor the temperature of the coagulated tissue and has a range up to 125
degrees Celsius. The surgeon may also use this temperature reading as a point
of reference to determine the extent of tissue coagulation.
The AtriCure Bipolar Coagulation System meets the following performance
industrial/international standards.

Trade/Device Name: AtriCure Bipolar Coagulation System
Regulation Number: 878.4400
Regulatory Class: Il
Product Code: GEI
Dated: May 31, 2001
Received: June 4, 2001
Dear Dr. Friedman:
We have reviewed your Section’510(k) notification of intent to market the device referenced
above and we have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use
stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce
prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act (Act). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls
provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual
registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against
misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III
(Premarket Approval), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations
affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 895.
A substantially equivalent determination assumes compliance with the Current Good
Manufacturing Practice requirements, as set forth in the Quality System Regulation (QS) for
Medical Devices: General regulation (21 CFR Part 820) and that, through periodic Qs
inspections, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will verify such assumptions. Failure to
comply with the GMP regulation may result in regulatory action. In addition, FDA may publish
further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register. Please note: this
response to your premarket notification submission does not affect any obligation you might
have under sections 531 through 542 of the Act for devices under the Electronic Product
Radiation Control provisions, or other Federal laws or regulations.

Page 2 - Mark L. Friedman, Ph.D.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your 510(k) premarket
notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed
predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to
proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801 and
additionally 809.10 for in vitro diagnostic devices), please contact the Office of Compliance at
— 301) 594-4659. Additionally, for questions on the promotion and advertising of your device,

please contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4639. Also, please note the regulation
entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR 807.97). Other general
information on your responsibilities under the Act may be obtained from the Division of Small
Manufacturers International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
(301) 443-6597 or at its internet address “http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/dsma/dsmamain. html".
