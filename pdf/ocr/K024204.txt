SLOVENIA
Contact Person : Mojea Valjavec
Preparation Date : 12-10-02
Device Trade Names : Fotona Fidelis Plus Nd:YAG Laser System
Common Name : Nd:YAG Laser /
Classification Name: Instrument, Surgical, Powered, Laser
79-GEX
21 CFR 878-48
II. Description
The Fotona Fidelis Plus Nd:YAG system is a microprocessor controlled device which
; generates laser light with a wavelength of 1064 nm when used in conjunction with a host
Fidelis Er: YAG system. When combined, the Nd:YAG (1064 nm) accessory and the host
Er:YAG system constitute the Fidelis Plus laser system.
The Fotona Fidelis Plus Nd:YAG system is designed as an accessory for use with the
Fotona Fidelis Er: YAG taser system. The Nd:YAG (1064 nm) sub-system is functionally
integrated to the host laser system. When integrated, the host laser system recognizes the
presence of the accessory and permits activation of the 1064 nm pulsed light via the same
touchscreen as the host Er:YAG.
: The Fidelis Plus Nd:YAG laser system consists of 3 major sub-systems:
a) An optical delivery system, interfacing the energy from the laser to the patient via an
optical fiber and a handpiece.
b) An electronic power supply and interface circuitry.
7 c) An optical chamber containing laser rod and laser cavity optics.

lil. Intended Use
The Fotona Fidelis Plus Nd:YAG Laser System and Accessories is intended for incision,
excision and coagulation of intraoral soft tissue, including the marginal and interdental
gingiva. This includes incising, excising and coagulating the epithelium lining, the free or
marginal gingiva, sulcular debridement (removal of diseased or inflamed soft tissue in
the periodontal pocket).
IV. Summary of Substantial Equivalence
Fotona believes that its Fidelis Plus Nd:YAG laser system is substantially equivalent to
the Sunlase 800P Nd:YAG laser system previously cleared for incision, excision and
coagulation of intraoral soft tissue, including the marginal and interdental gingiva. It
therefore has the same Intended Use as the Fotona Fidelis Plus Nd: YAG laser system..
Technologically, the predicate device has similar characteristics to the Fotona Fidelis

~ . Plus Nd:YAG, both comprising a flashlamp pumped Nd:YAG laser rod generating light
at a wavelength of 1064 nm, which is subsequently delivered to the patient via an optical
fiber delivery system and exits the proximal tip of the fiber. :
The risk and benefits for the Fotona Fidelis Plus Nd:YAG laser system are comparable to
the predicate devices when used for similar clinical applications.
It is therefore believed that there are no new questions of Safety or Effectiveness raised
by the introduction of the Fotona Fidelis Plus Nd:YAG laser system.

Dear Mr, Lukac:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate’
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Additionally, for questions on the
promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 5944639. Also, please note the regulation entitled, “Misbranding by reference to premarket
notification” (21CFR Part 807.97) you may obtain. Other general information on your
