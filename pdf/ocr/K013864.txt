spots (2, 3, 4, and 5mm), output power, dwell time, density and fluence rates. The
| Epi-Star Surgical Laser can achieve fluence rates of up to 400 J/em? when
coupled with the cooling accessories. The treatment parameters for the
classifications of various skin types is provided. The Epi-Star laser can be
coupled with either a scanner handpiece that has a cooling window (Model A) or
with a scanner and cold air system (Model B).
18.5 SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE
The Epi-Star Surgical Laser System with the proposed modifications is
substantially equivalent to the current Epi-Star Surgical Laser System that is
currently in commercial distribution by Nidek, Inc.
The fundamental technical characteristics of the Epi-Star Surgical Laser System
are the same as those of the predicate device and the indications for use has not
changed with the modifications of the device.
18.6 INDICATIONS FOR USE
The Epi-Star Surgical Laser System is intended to be used for Plastic Surgery and
Dermatology, with the intended uses for the treatment of vascular and pigmented
lesions and for the removal of hair in skin types I -— VI.
18.7 TECHNOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS
The modifications to the Epi-Star Laser System allow for higher fluence rates of
up to 400 J/cm? for the treatment of vascular and pigmented lesions and the
removal of hair. The increased fluence rates are dependent on the skin types to be
treated and are self-limiting by the laser system. The output power of the system
is from 5 - 60 Watts, the aiming beam is 620 — 650 nm and the pulse duration is 5
— 700 ms. Spot sizes of 2, 3, 4, and 5mm can be accomplished with the Epi-Star.
Model A includes a scanner with a 2-TE chip cooling window and Model B
includes a scanner attached to a cold air system. The current Epi-Star Laser

510(k) Amendment, #K013864, January 4, 2002
System allows for fluence rates of up to 50 J/cm’. The current Epi-Star includes a
scanner with a 1-TE chip cooling window.

18.8 PERFORMANCE DATA
Performance testing was conducted on the Epi-Star Surgical Laser System.
System and component testing was completed based on product specifications and
hazard effects determined from the risk analysis. A preclinical animal study was
conducted to determine the safety of the Epi-Star Surgical Laser System with the
higher fluence rates. The Epi-Star Surgical Laser System was found to perform as
intended.

18.9 CONCLUSION
This notification contains all information required by 21 CFR 807.87. The EpiStar Surgical Laser System with the higher fluence rates was found to perform as
intended during validation testing and in preclinical animal studies. The Epi-Star
Surgical Laser System is substantially equivalent to the current Epi-Star Surgical
Laser System in commercial distribution. The Epi-Star Surgical Laser System is
intended for the treatment of vascular and pigmented lesions and for the removal
of hair.

Dear Ms. White:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may

or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
