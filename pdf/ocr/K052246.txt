The en-bloc Biopsy System is intended to provide breast tissue for histologic examination with
partial removal of a palpable abnormality.
The extent of a histologic abnormality cannot always be readily determined from palpation or
imaged appearance. Therefore, the extent of removal of the palpable or imaged evidence of an
abnormality does not predict the extent of removal of a histologic abnormality, e.g., malignancy.
When the sampled abnormality is not histologically benign, it is essential that the tissue margins
be examined for completeness of removal using standard surgical procedures.
In instances when a patient presents with a palpable abnormality that has been classified as
benign through clinical and/or radiological criteria (e.g., fibroadenoma, fibrocystic lesion), the
en-bloc Biopsy System may also be used to partially remove such palpable lesions. Whenever
breast tissue is removed, histologic evaluation of the tissue is the standard of care. When the
sampled abnormality is not histologically benign, it is essential that the tissue margins be
examined for completeness of removal using standard surgical procedures.
Technological Characteristics
The en-bloc is a percutaneous high frequency, automated, vacuum-assisted
electrosurgical device used to remove tissue by automated electrosurgical cutting and
simultaneous capture of an incised tissue volume. The Neothermia en-bloc ™ consists of
a hand-held biopsy handle, upon which the single-use en-bloc Biopsy Probe is attached,
with an integral cable to connect the handle to the control unit. The Probe™ contains two
sets of active electrodes at its distal end — a precursor electrode and cutting/capture
electrodes. The shaft of the Probe™ is encased in a stainless steel cannula. An outer
plastic sleeve surrounds this stainless steel cannula and an annular gap between the sleeve
and the cannula provides a conduit for vacuum-assisted removal of the gaseous products
of electrosurgical cutting and any liquids (e.g., blood) that may accumulate at the distal
end of the Probe during the biopsy procedure. The vacuum also helps maintain the
required cutting arc during automated tissue capture.
Substantial Equivalence
The probe with this manufacturing modification has the same intended use, principles of
operation, and technological characteristics as the previously cleared predicate devices.
The en-bloc probe with the manufacturing modification and its predicate devices are both
electrosurgical devices used to biopsy breast tissue. The en-bloc probe with the
manufacturing modification is substantially equivalent to Neothermia’s cleared 10mm,
12mm, 15mm and 20mm en-bloc probes.
The modified Indications for Use are consistent with those of the predicate device
(Mammotome). These Indications for Use are based upon the predicate devices ability to
partially or completely remove imaged abnormalities. The en-block Biopsy System has
been shown to be equally capable of partially or completely removing imaged
abnormalities.

Dear Mr. Jacobs:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2- Mr. David Jacobs
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
“Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
(301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/dsma/dsmamain.html
