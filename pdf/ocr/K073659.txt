S10(k) Summary
XTRAC Ultra? Excimer Laser, Model AL10000
4. DEVICE DESCRIPTION
The XTRAC Ultra” Excimer Laser System, Model AL10000 is a complete self-contained
compact UVB laser light source, which utilizes a XeC] gas mixture to generate an
operator selected dose and target-specific ultraviolet light at monochromatic wavelength
of 308 nm. The laser system consists of a touch-screen display, an advanced fiberoptic
cable attached to a handpiece, and a foot-switch to initiate exposure. The laser is
enclosed in a protective interlocked housing. The unit is designed to operate on standard
AC power available from wall outlets and can accommodate US, European and other
nominal supply voltages and operating frequencies.
5. INTENDED USE
The intended use is targeted UVB phototherapy for treatment of the skin conditions
including psoriasis, vitiligo, atopic dermatitis, and leukoderma.
6. SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE
The application of the Excimer Laser phototherapy has been proven to be substantially
equivalent to current legally marketed devices in the treatment of indications previously
cleared by CDRH (ODE). PhotoMedex has been granted clearance via K992914,
K003705, K011382, K020847, K031451 and K041943 for this method of phototherapy
generation.
The intended use for the PhotoMedex XTRAC Ultra” Excimer Laser System, Model
AL10000, and the identified predicate devices are identical in that they are ail excimer
lasers used to produce monochromatic (308nm) UVB light for the purpose of targeted,
dose controlled UVB (dermatological) phototherapy. The difference between the
XTRAC Ultra” Excimer Laser System, Model AL10000, and the identified predicates is
limited to a moderate increase in the maximum laser repetition rate. We believe the reprate increase will not affect the device’s safety or intended use as compared to the
identified predicates.
7. CLINICAL PERFORMANCE TESTING
All clinical indications requested in this application have been previously cleared in the
identified predicate devices. The XTRAC Ultra” Excimer Laser System, Model
AL10000 does not introduce any new indications for use, and will perform in an identical
manner as the identified predicates, therefore PhotoMedex believes duplicative clinical
data is not required as a condition of granting market clearance for the XTRAC Ultra”
Excimer Laser System, Model AL10000.

Excimer Laser System, Model AL10000 also has been reviewed for risk management
utilizing ISO 14971, Application of risk management to medical devices ensuring all
aspects of the device are reviewed for potential hazards.
9. CONCLUSIONS
PhotoMedex believes the XTRAC Ultra” Excimer Laser System, Model AL10000 is
substantially equivalent to the identified predicates in that it does not introduce any new
issues of safety or efficiency as compared to the predicates. The indications for use,
methods of operation and power source are identical to the predicates.

Dear Mr. Levatter:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CER Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

Page 2 — Mr. Jeff Levatter
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
