Common/Usual Name: Electrosurgical Instruments :
Classification Name: Electrosurgical Cutting and Coagulation Device And Accessories

(21 CFR 878.4400)
Proprietary Name: PK ZIP WING Cutting Dissector
The device is a Class II medical device. The PK ZIP WING Cutting Dissecting forceps is a
modification to the predicate devices cleared under K904993. The bipolar dissecting forceps is
identical in construction (with the exception of shaft length) and in component materials when
compared to the predicate device. The dissector jaws are electrically isolated from each other
enabling one jaw to act as a return electrode, eliminating the need for a return pad. In addition a
cutting electrode mounted in one of the jaws is electrically isolated from the dissector jaw enabling
the jaw to act as a return electrode. The modification has not altered the fundamental technology of
the predicate devices cleared under K904993. The intended use: Electrosurgical cutting and
coagulation, grasping and dissection during surgical procedures is identical when compared to the
predicate devices. The energy source, Bipolar Electrosurgical Energy, is the same energy type as
used for the predicate devices.
In conclusion, as the design, materials of construction, function and intended use of the PK ZIP
Wing Cutting Dissector is similar to that of the predicate devices currently cleared, Gyrus Medical
Inc. believes that no new issues of safety and effectiveness are raised and that the submitted device
is substantially equivalent.
