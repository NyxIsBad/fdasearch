1. Device Name
Trade Name: BiTech Bipolar Scissors
Common Name: Bipolar Scissors
2. Classification
Device: Device, Electrosurgical, Cutting & Coagulation & Accessories
Device description: P’ectrosurgical cutting and coagulation device and accessoMedical Specialty: Part 878, General & Plastic Surgery
Product Code: GEI
Regulation Number: | 878.4400
Device Class: 2
3. Substantial Equivalence
BiTech Bipolar Scissors are substantially equivalent to other legally marketed Bipolar Scissors
from different manufacturers, e.g.
= Ethicon, Inc. (K981361);
= Enable, (K972558).
4. Description of the Device
BiTech bipolar scissors enable cutting and dissection with simulataneous bipolar coagulation.
They can also be used for precise pinpoint or zone coagulation of blood-vessels and tissue. The
various working lengths allow the scissors to be used for a large number of applications in open
surgery.
A petented construction priciple, which was developed by Dr. J. Manushakian’, ensures that the
scissors are both easy to use and to repair. The electrical contacts for both scissor blades are
conducted via one section of the handle, i. e. the connection cable only needs to be attached to
one ring, which significantly reduces reference duriong handling. The scissor blades are flexibly
joined by means of a standard steel scissor screw which does not need to be insulated and, as a
result, is not subject to wear.
“Patented: US 6,355,035, EPO 99107816.3.
5. Intended Use
BiTech bipolar scissors are designed for dissecting, cutting and bipolar coagulation of tissue during general surgical procedures.
The BiTech Bipolar Scissors has not been shown to be effective for tubal sterilization or tubat
coagulation for sterilization procedures and should not be used for these procedures.

DIN EN 60601-2-2: Medical electrical equipment - Part 2-2: Particular requirements for the safety
of high frequency surgical equipment (IEC 60601-2-2:1998); German version EN 60601-2-2:2000;
Version: 01-Aug-2001;
ANSI/AAMI HF 18-2001: Electrosurgical Devices; Version: 01-May-2001.
7. Sterilization by User
BiTech Bipolar Scissors are delivered in non-sterile conditions. The user may sterilize these devices by using a validated and applicable sterilization process.
Cleaning and Maintenance
Every surgical instrument should be disinfected and thoroughly cleaned after each use. Proper
cleaning, inspection and maintenance will help ensure correct function of the surgical instrument.
Clean, inspect and test each instrument carefully. Sterilise all instruments before surgery. A good
cleaning and maintenance procedure will extend the useful life of the instrument.
Special attention must be paid to slots, stops, ends, hollow tubes and other highly inaccessible
areas. Check insulation, cables and connectors for cuts, voids, cracks, tears, abrasions, etc.
Do not use damaged instruments.
Cleaning and rinsing must take place immediately after each use for best effect. Failure to clean
promptly may result in adherent particles or dried secretions that may resist cleaning and complicate or resist future sterilisation.
Instruments must be completely cleaned and rinsed of all foreign matter.
Use warm water and a commercially available instrument pre-soak or cleaning agent. Enzymatic
cleaners (such as Enzol™) must be used to remove protein deposits. Follow the enzymatic
cleaner's instructions; rinse thoroughly.
« Do not use corrosive cleaning agents (i.e. bleach). Cleaning solutions and rinses at or near a
neutral pH (7.0) are best.
« Do not use abrasive cleaners.
¢ Only a soft bristle brush should be used.
« Immerse the entire device in detergent and clean while soaking.
Rinse with sterile deionized water.
Can be disinfected in the washing machine up to 203°F (95°C).
e Rinse thoroughly with distilled water.
e Prepare for storage and/or sterilisation.
Sterilisation
Only a validated steam-sterilization process according DIN EN 554 that uses a sterilization cycle
of 137°C / 280°F, 3 bar, for min. 15 minutes has to be used.
(Note: Contact the manufacturer of your steam autoclave to confirm appropriate temperatures and
sterilisation times.)
Caution: Autoclave temperatures should not exceed 280°F (137°C); handles, insulation or other
non-metallic parts may be damaged
Do not sterilise with hot air.
Do not use ‘Flash’ autoclave procedures.

Dear Mr. Menean:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (2!
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
