2. Device &
Classification Name: Laser Handpiece Accessory System (Class 2), Product Code GEX,
21 CFR 878.4810 — Tradename of device: Serenity Pro PSF™ System

3. Predicate Device: inolase Serenity PSF™ (Pneumatic Skin Flattening) System (K062589)

4. Description: The Serenity Pro PSF™ System is a device which has the ability to produce a
vacuum at a level of 400-700 mbar. Suction can be delivered through its handpiece,
which has a sapphire window at its distal end, to be positioned over the skin for laser
or IPL treatment. When the PSF system is activated, the negative pressure results in
the flattening of the skin of the treatment site. During the time duration of suction, the
treatment beam of the laser or IPL is administered through the sapphire window of
the handpiece, which is transparent and thermally conductive. The resultant tight
mechanical contact produced by the PSF expeis biood from the treatment site which
enhances the light penetration of the laser or IPL in tissue as well as the removal of
its heat from the skin. This can reduce the possibility of post treatment
erythema.

5. intended Use: The Serenity PSF™ (Pneumatic Skin Flattening) System is an accessory for a
compatible legally market Laser or intense Pulse Light System for use in hair
removal. Its handpiece produces a negative pressure over the skin surface just prior
to the administration of the treatment beam through it.

6. Comparison of

Technological With respect to technology, the Serenity Pro PSF™ System is substantially
Characteristics: equivalent to its predicate device in that it produces a pneumatic connection of the
treatment site for the delivery of photonic treatment. A significant difference is the
ability of its handpieces to manually or automatically produce a vacuum over the
treatment site

Dear Mr. Hattub:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

» forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic

product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
