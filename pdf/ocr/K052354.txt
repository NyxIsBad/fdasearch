pinpoints the area of treatment. The optical power output may be adjusted to
specific user requirements for tissue applications. Laser radiation is delivered

from the laser unit to the handpiece through the optical fiber. A sterile water spray
is emitted at the same time laser radiation is delivered to the tissue site. The
handpiece is rotatable and detachable from the optical shaft. The tip is detachable
from the handpiece and serves as the optical power conduit to the target tissue.

5. Indications for Use
The Oculase MD is indicated for use in general ophthalmic soft tissue surgical
indications such as: incision, excision, vaporization and coagulation of ocular
tissue and tissue surrounding the eye and orbit.
