VI. ‘Rationale for Substantial Equivalence
The Lumenis Family of Disposable Contact Tip Delivery Devices for CO) Lasers shares
the same or similar indications for use in surgical applications, overall dimensions, tip
shapes, tip/tissue temperature, materials, sterilization process, and system compatibility,
and therefore is substantially equivalent to the Oral/ENT Fiber Delivery Devices
manufactured by Lumenis (K022060), the predicate Series 2900 Synthetic Contact Tips
manufactured by ESC Sharplan (K894211), the SLT Contact and Diffuser Tips with
Wavelength Conversion surface treatment manufactured by Surgical Laser Technologies
(K010041, K980156, K882212, K872254, and K872253), the Somnoplasty System
manufactured by Somnus Medical Technologies (K973618), and the Bipolar
Electrosurgical ENTec Plasma Wands manufactured by ArthroCare Corporation
(K021364). In addition, validation data demonstrated adequate device performance.
VII. Safety and Effectiveness Information
Performance data were provided to demonstrate that the Lumenis Family of Disposable
Contact Tip Delivery Devices for CO, Lasers operates in accordance with product
specifications.
VII. Conclusion
The Lumenis Family of Disposable Contact Tip Delivery Devices for CO, Lasers was
found to be substantially equivalent to the predicate Lumenis Oral/ENT Fiber Delivery
Devices (K022060), the predicate ESC Sharplan Series 2900 Synthetic Contact Tips
(K894211), the SLT Contact and Diffuser Tips with Wavelength Conversion surface
treatment (K010041, K980156, K882212, K872254, and K872253), the Somnus Medical
Technologies Somnoplasty System (K973618), and the ArthroCare ENTec Plasma Wands
(K021364). The Lumenis Family of Disposable Contact Tip Delivery Devices for CO
Lasers shares similar indications for use in surgical applications, design features, and
similar functional features, and thus, is substantially equivalent to the predicate devices.

Dear Dr. Murari:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of

. devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and

adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
