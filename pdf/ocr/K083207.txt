IPL

§90-1200nm ; 625-1200nm; 650-1200nm

Indicated for permanent hair reduction.

650-1200nm ; 570-12000m

Indicated for photocoagulation of dermatological
vascular lesion ( i.e.,face telangiectasia),
photothermolysis of blood vessels (treatment of facial
and leg veins), and treatment of benign pigmented
lesions.

400-1200nm

Indicated for inflammatory acne (acne vulgaris).

Integrated Skin Cooler

The intended use of the integrated cooling system in the

laser hand piece is to provide cooling of the skin prior to
laser treatment, for the reduction of pain during laser
treatment, ta allow for the use of higher fluencies for
laser treatments such as hair removal and vascular
lesion, and to reduce the potential side effects of laser
treatments.
Any other different use is considered incorrect.
The Ultrawave ITI EX 1320 consists of twe laser sources
and an IPL. The laser sources emit wavelengths of
Technological 1064nm (long pulse and short pulse),1320nm and
Characteristics: 582nm for the Nd:YAG source and 755nm for the
Alexandrite source. The IPI, has several different
spectral ranges to be utilized for different applications:
400-1200nm, 550-1200nm, 570-1200nm, 590-1200nm,
625-1200nm and 650-1200nm. In addition, the
Ultrawave TIT EX 1320 includes a power supply; a
cooling system; an optical delivery system; a
microprocessor based controller; an integral skin cooler;
and safety features to ensure use of the appropriate
laser, wavelength and hand piece.
Performance data was provided showing the Ultrawave
TI] EX 1820 is capable of performing fractional
Performance Data photothermolysis, ie, creation of pattern (lattice) of
microscopic islets of damage at superficial skin layers.
The Quanta System Ultrawave III EX 1320 is as safe
and effective as the predicate devices. The Ultrawave
Substantial Il EX 1320 has the same intended uses and similar
Equivalence: indications, technological characteristics, and principles
of operation as its predicate device. The minor
technological differences between the Ultrawave ITI EX
1320 and its predicate devices raise no new issues of
safety or effectiveness. Thus, the Ultrawave HI EX
1320 is substantially equivalent.
