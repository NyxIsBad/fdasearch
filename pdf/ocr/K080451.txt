Regulatory Class: I
Legally marketed device to which equivalence is claimed:
Angiodynamics Uniblate Electrosurgical Device, 510(k) K070101
Angiodynamics (formerly RITA Medical Systems) Starburst Electrosurgical Device
510(k) K030967
Valleylab Cool-Tip Electrosurgical probe, 510(k) K052796
Intended Use / Indications
The AngioDynamics Uniblate System is intended for coagulation and ablation of tissue
during percutaneous, laparoscopic, and intraoperative surgical procedures, such as partial
or complete ablation of non-resectable liver lesions, osteoid osteoma, and palliation of
pain associated with metastatic lesions involving bone in patients who have failed or are
not candidates for standard therapy.

. Device Description
“ge 8 AG)
The UniBlate Electrosurgical Device is a monopolar radiofrequency (RF) device that consists of a
variably insulated electrode that provides an adjustable ablation zone of 1 cm~3 om.. The device
has an attached electrical cable and infusion tubing set which connects the it directly to the RITA
Medical 1500X RF generator and the IntelliFlow peristaltic pump. The electrical cable provides
RF energy and temperature feedback to the generator and the pump infuses normal saline through
the infusion tubing set. The UniBlate Electrosurgical Device is a single use device.
Technological Differences:
The AngioDynamics UniBlate, AngioDynamics Starburst Electrosurgical device (K030967), and
Valleylab Cool-Tip (K052796) are monopolar electrodes used to deliver RF energy during open,
laparoscopic or percutaneous procedures to ablate and coagulate soft tissue. The UniBlate is
designed to provide a scaleable coagulation zone. The UniBlate electrode has a single active
electrode that can be exposed from 1 cm to 2.5 cm by retracting an insulating sheath. The CoolTip has a fixed length active electrode, but is available in different sizes of lcm, 2cm, and 3cm.
The UniBlate allows for local fluid delivery as well as temperature monitoring. The Starburst
SDE is a mulit-tined probe that provides an adjustable ablation zone up to 2cm.
Intended Use
The AngioDynamics Uniblate Electrosurgical Device is intended for coagulation and
ablation of tissue during percutaneous, laparoscopic, and intraoperative surgical
procedures, such as partial or complete ablation of non-resectable liver lesions, osteoid
_ , osteoma, and palliation of pain associated with metastatic lesions involving bone in
patients who have failed or are not candidates for standard therapy
The Angiodynamics Starburst electrosurgical device is indicated for coagulation and
ablation of tissue during percutaneous, laparoscopic, and intraoperative surgical
procedures, such as partial or complete ablation of non-resectable liver lesions and
palliation of pain associated with metastatic lesions involving bone in patients who have
failed or are not candidates for standard therapy
The Valleylab Cool-tip RF System (generator and accessories) is intended for the
use in percutaneous, laparoscopic, intraoperative coagulation and ablation of
tissue, such as partial or complete ablation of non-resectable liver lesions and osteoid.

Dear Mr. Kunst:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 — Mr. Brian Kunst
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
