Device Trade Name: LVI lase
Common Name: Dental diode laser
Classification Name: Instrument, surgical, powered, laser
Classification Code: 79-GEX
Equivalent Device(s): DioDent Dental Laser System by HOYA ConBio,
Aurora by Premier Laser System,
Twilite or Dentek LD-15 Diode Laser System by BioLase
Technologies,
DioLase ST by American Medical Technology (formerly ADT)
Intended Use: The LVI lase is intended for incision,
excision, ablation, vaporization, and/or coagulation of oral soft
tissue (including marginal and interdental gingival and epithelial
lining of free gingiva). It is also intended for light activation for
bleaching materials for teeth whitening, and laser-assisted
bleaching/whitening for teeth whitening.

System, the Aurora Diode Laser System, the
Twilite/Dentek LD-15, the Dental Diode Laser, and the DioLase
ST are equivalent in operating parameters, physical characteristics,
and intended uses. (NOTE: Of the equivalent devices mentioned
here, only the DioDent and the Twilite are cleared for teeth
whitening intended uses. The LVI lase is seeking clearance for
this in this submission).

Dear Ms. Burns
This letter corrects our substantially equivalent letter of August 5, 2004.
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices,
good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be
found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with ali the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to continue marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (2! CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
