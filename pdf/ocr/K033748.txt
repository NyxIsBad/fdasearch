E. Device Description
The Trident Resection Ablator is a combination of a 4.2mm _ Linvatec
arthroscopic shaver blade and a Linvatec UltrAblator® monopolar electrode.
The product configuration combines the mechanical resection of a shaver
blade and the ablation and hemostasis functions of an electrode. The
Trident Resection Ablator is supplied sterile, single use.
The modification to the Trident Resection Ablator described in this Special
510(k) is a change in the material formulation of the electrical insulation
coating. This modification does not affect the device's intended use,
fundamental scientific technology, performance specifications or labeling.

F. Intended Use
The Trident Resection Ablator is intended to be used in arthroscopic
procedures for resection and ablation of soft tissue, and hemostasis of blood
vessels.

G. Substantial Equivalence
The Trident Resection Ablator is substantially equivalent in design,
technology and intended use to the existing Resection Ablator and
UltrAblator Electrode. Testing has been conducted to assure that the
change in the material formulation of the insulation coating does not raise
any new issues regarding safety and effectiveness.

devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general contro}s provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
