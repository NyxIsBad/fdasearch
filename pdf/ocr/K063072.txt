Device Description
The Candela Family of Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser (Alex.azr) systems: 532 Nd:YAG
Handpiece Accessory consists of a cylindrical housing connecting to the distal end of the optical
fiber which plugs into the standard Candela Family of Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser (Alexzazr)
systems. The fiber carries the 755nm light from the Candela Family of Q-Switched Alexandrite
Laser (Alexz,zr) systems to the handpiece at the distal end where the wavelength conversion
from 755nm to 532nm occurs. The principle of operation is outlined here. The 755nm light is
focused by focusing lenses to a 2mm beam waist within an Nd:YAG rod situated in the heart of
the converter module. It is known that Nd:YAG can be pumped at 755nm and made to lase at
1064nm with high efficiency. The Nd:YAG rod has two appropriately coated mirrors, one on
either side, to form a laser resonator. Within the laser resonator is a Brewster Plate which
1 k

ensures that the output 1064nm beam is polarized (in another variation of the same scheme, the
Nd:YAG will be replaced by Nd: YVO4 or similar gain medium which provides a naturally
polarized output, eliminating the need for a Brewster Plate). The output of the Nd:YAG laser has
the same pulse duration as the original 755nm laser, but the wavelength is now 1064nm. The
1064nm beam is then incident on a KTP crystal that is aligned for optimum phase matching for
second harmonic generation at 1064nm. The KTP crystal converts 1064nm to 532nm efficiently.
A dichroic beam-splitter separates the 532nm beam from the residual unconverted 1064nm. The
532nm beam is appropriately shaped and sized using lenses and is incident on the skin during
treatment. The unconverted 1064nm that is rejected by the beam-splitter is safely absorbed in a
beam dump within the module.
The Candela Family of Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser (Alex. azr) systems: 1064 Nd: YAG
Handpiece Accessory is very similar to the 532nm handpiece except that there is no KTP crystal
for the 1064nm to 532nm conversion. The beam is extracted immediately after the Nd:YAG
laser resonator.
Description of Intended Use
The Candela Family of Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser (Alex; zp) Systems: 532 and 1064
Nd:YAG Handpiece Accessories are indicated for the following uses:
Tattoo Removal
Treatment of Vascular Lesions
Treatment of Pigmented Lesions
Incision, Excision, Ablation, Vaporization of Soft Tissue for General Dermatology
Rationale for Substantial Equivalence
The Candela Family of Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser (Alex,4za) Systems: 532 and 1064
Nd:YAG Handpiece Accessories have the same intended use and utilizes similar functional
features (including power output, spot size, repetition rate, energy, and fluence) and matches key
design aspects (including wavelength, light generation medium, power supply, cooling and
controls system) as the predicate devices.
The Candela Family of Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser (Alex. azr) Systems: 532 and 1064
Nd:YAG Handpiece Accessories shares similar methods of assembly, method of operation and
intended uses, and therefore is substantially equivalent to the currently legally marketed Hoya
ConBio Inc., Medlite C3 Q-Switched Nd:YAG Laser, K011677, Candela Q-Switched, Frequency
Doubled, Nd:YAG Laser System, K942152, and Candela Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser
(AlexLAZR), K955662.
Safety and Effectiveness Information
The Candela Family of Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser (Alexyazr) Systems: 532 and 1064
Nd:YAG Handpiece Accessories are substantial equivalent to the currently legally marketed
Hoya ConBio Inc., Medlite C3 Q-Switched Nd: YAG Laser, K011677, Candela Q-Switched,
Frequency Doubled, Nd:YAG Laser System, K942152, and Candela Q-Switched Alexandrite
Laser (AlexLAZR), K955662 predicate devices in intended use and technological features and
therefore the risks and benefits are comparable to the predicate devices.

2

We therefore believe that there are no new questions of safety or effectiveness raised by the
introduction of Candela Family of Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser (Alex; ,zr) Systems: 532 and
1064 Nd:YAG Handpiece Accessories.

Conclusion

Base on the similarities in indications for use, design features, and functional features Candela
Family of Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser (Alex,4zr) Systems: 532 and 1064 Nd:YAG Handpiece
Accessories have been shown to be substantially equivalent to the current legally marketed
predicate devices.

Dear Mr. Roberts:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

Page 2 — Mr. Jeffrey Roberts
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
(240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address http://www. fda.gov/cdrh/industry/support/index.html.
