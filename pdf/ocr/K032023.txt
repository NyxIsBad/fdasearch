510(K) SUMMARY
Page -2- / -3Intended Use and Indication for Use:

e The W.O.M. Laser U100plus is intended for use in endoscopic surgical
procedures to fragment stones.

e The W.O.M. Laser U100plus is indicated for use to fragment urinary stones
(kidney, ureter and bladder) and biliary stones in the contact mode during
closed surgical procedures.

Technical Characteristics and Substantial Equivalence:

The W.O.M. Laser U100p/us and the predicate devices are intended for use in

endoscopic surgical procedures to fragment stones. All three devices are

indicated for use to fragment urinary and biliary stones in the contact mode during
closed surgical procedures. However, the Dornier Medilas H/2 (K984591) is also
indicated for use in cutting, vaporization, ablation and coagulation of soft tissue.

The W.O.M. Laser U100pius and the predicate device W.O.M. Laser U100

(K023041) have identical principles of operation and similar technological

characteristics. Both devices use the same physical processes to generate the laser

beams and method of transmission to the stone. The W.O.M. Laser U100plus and
the predicate device transmit pulses of laser energy by a quartz fiber to the stone_

(contact mode). The laser pulses are transformed into an ultrasonic wave

(acoustic impact waves) which mechanically crush the stone. The proposed

device and the predicate device W.O.M. Laser U100 devices incorporate an

internal water cooling cycle with a water-air heat exchanger system. In addition.
both devices provide the same safety features and similar parameters are
displayed on the operator panel of the devices. The differences between the two
laser devices are a minor increasement of the pulse energy and pulse frequency
and the option of a double pulse seftine

The W.O.M. Laser U100p/us and the predicate device Dornier Medilas H/2

(K984591) generate their respective laser beam through different physical

processes. The predicate device Dornier Medilas H/2 is a Holmium: YAG laser.

that operates with a thermal decomposition of the stone materat-Unttke the

Dornier Medilas H/2. the laser effect of the W.O.M. Laser U100p/us is non
thermal and does not lead to a critical heating of the operating area. This

represents a substantial improvement in the safety of laser lithotripsy by avoiding

the risk of tissue injury that may result from the use of an Holmimum: Y AG laser

to fragment stones in the urinary tract.

510(K) SUMMARY

Page -3- / -3The differences of the W.O.M. Laser U100plus to the predicate device W.O.M.
Laser U100 (K023041) are minor and raise no new questions of safety and
effectiveness. Moreover the differences between both devices result in an
improvement of the stone fragmentation efficiency. In addition, W.O.M. believes
that the differences of the W.O.M. Laser UL00plus and the Dornier Medilas H/2
(K984591) do not raise any concerns regarding the safety and effectiveness.
Moreover, the non-thermal and non-cutting properties of the W.O.M. Laser
U100plus represent a substantial improvement in the safety of laser lithotripsy.

Safety and Effectiveness Information:
In vitro, in vivo and clinical data has been provided to demonstrate that the
W.O.M. Laser U100plus is safe and effective for the fragmentation of biliary
stones in closed surgical procedures.
The device complies with the International Standard IEC 60601-1 (Electrical
Safety) and [EC 60601-1-2 (Electromagnetic Compatibility). In addition, the
device meets the requirements of the Underwriter Laboratories Standard UL
2601-1 and bears the CE mark in accordance with the Medical Device Directive
93/42/EEC.

Conclusion:
The W.O.M. Laser U100plus has the same intended use, similiar design features
and identical principles of operation as the predicate device W.O.M. Laser UL00
(K023041). Moreover, the W.0.M. Laser U100p/us has the same intended use
and indication for use as the Dornier Medilas H/2 (K984591). The differences of
the W.O.M. Laser U100p/us to the predicate device W.O.M. Laser U100
(K023041) are minor and raise no new questions of safety and effectiveness.
Finally, in vitro, in vivo and clinical study results demonstrate that the W.O.M.
Laser UL00p/us is safe and effective for the fragmentation of urinary and biliary
stones in closed surgical procedures.
Accordingly, W.O.M. WORLD OF MEDICINE AG believes that the W.O.M.
Laser U100plus is substantially equivalent to the W.O.M. Laser U100 (K023041)
and the Domier Medilas H/2 (K984591).

Dear Ms. Raab:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
