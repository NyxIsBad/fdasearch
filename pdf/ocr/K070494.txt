SECTION 4: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Device Description MAY - 1 2007
The device is designed and manufactured to emit a high intensity pulsed light applied

to the patient’s skin. The light is emitted by a quick discharge of capacitors on a xenon

flash lamp with a high energy. ‘The lamp delivers a wavelength in the baad of 390
1200nm.

The three principal parts of this system are:

1. The Principal Unit which contain all circuitry to control the device, This unit

is composed of:

° Power Supply section which allows the necessary power supply to the
system (power supply socket, main switch, power supply transformer, and

¢ Control section is composed of control board PC board and human
interface system (TFT display )

¢ Power section allows generating and storing the energy used to generate
the output light. It is composed of power board and power capacitors,

2. The Handpiece contains circuitry to control the Lamp & Filter group. It is
connected with the principal unit with a removable cable
3. The Lamp & Filter group is a removable box that contains Xenon Flash
Lamp and Filter mounted on to the handpiece.
