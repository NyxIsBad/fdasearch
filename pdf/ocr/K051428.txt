2. DEVICE NAME
e Classification name: Ultraviolet lamp for dermatologic disorders; 21 CFR
§878.4630 — Class II
e Common or usual name: Targeted (localized) UVB Excimer Lamp Phototherapy
System
¢ Trade or proprietary name: VTRAC Excimer Lamp System
3. LEGALLY MARKETED PREDICATE DEVICES
TheraLight UV120-2 UVA / UVB Phototherapy System
Cleared via K024020 and K022165
Lumenis BClear™
Cleared via K020591 and K021762
Levia Phototherapy System
Cleared via K040062
4. DEVICE DESCRIPTION
The VTRAC Excimer Lamp System is a self-contained non-invasive (non-ablating)
dermatological phototherapy instrument that emits targeted (ultra-narrow) ultraviolet wavelength
that is included in the UV-B region of the electromagnetic spectrum centered at 308 nm, which
has been determined to effective for the treatment of skin conditions that respond favorably to
UV-B, narrow band UV-B, and monochromatic UV-B phototherapy. UNB-UVB is emitted from
a XeCl excimer lamp inside a handpiece used to apply targeted UVB energy to only areas that
require treatment, thus allowing non-involved areas (healthy) of the skin to be spared from
exposure.

S10(k): Premarket Notification
VTRAC Excimer Lamp System
5, INDICATIONS FOR USE
UVB phototherapy for skin conditions which include psoriasis, vitiligo, atopic dermatitis,
and leukoderma.
6. SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE

The intended use for the VTRAC Excimer Lamp System is similar to the predicate
devices identified in that the wavelength, energy, indicated used and safety
considerations are within the current applications of UV-B phototherapy, or supported by
published clinical data included in this application.

PhotoMedex believes the introduction of the VTRAC Excimer Lamp System poses no
new issues of safety and is similar in intended use as compared to the predicates
identified within this application.

7, SAFETY AND EFECTIVENESS; PRODUCT PERFORMANCE
The VTRAC Excimer Lamp System is designed, tested and are to be manufactured in
accordance with both mandatory and voluntary standards, including 21 CFR PART 820 the Quality System Regulation, EN60601-1, EN60601-1-2, EN 60601-1-4, EN ISO
14971, and UL2601-1 / UL60601-1. The inclusion of these standards will further ensure
when the VTRAC Excimer Lamp System is used according to the instructions for use,
that it is both safe and effective for the applications indicated.
8. CONCLUSIONS
Based on the information reviewed and provided within this application, PhotoMedex
believes that the VTRAC Excimer Lamp System is substantially equivalent to the
TheraLight UV120-2 UVA / UVB Phototherapy System, the Lumenis BClear™, and the
Levia Phototherapy System, in that it is safe and effective as the legally marketed
predicate devices, and that they share similar mechanisms for laser energy delivery and
indications for use.

referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
‘ commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.

or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
