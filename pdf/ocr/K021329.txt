510(K) SUMMARY OF SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS

General Trade Name: RITA® System

Provisions Common/Classification Name: Electrosurgical Radiofrequency Generator and
Electrosurgical Devices

Name of RITA Medical Systems Inc. — RITA® System (K983214, K992693, K993944,

Marketed Device K003676)

Radionics — Radiofrequency system (K963577, K965182, K980430, K982489)

Classification Class

Performance The FDA under section 514 of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act has not

Standards established performance standards.

Intended Use The RITA® System (RF generator and electrosurgical devices) supplies energy for
use in electrosurgery and is indicated for use in percutaneous, laparoscopic, or
intraoperative coagulation and ablation of soft tissue, including:

e the partial or complete ablation of non-resectable liver lesions and
« the palliation of pain associated with metastatic lesions involving bone in
patients who have failed or are not candidates for standard pain therapy.

Device The RITA System (RF Generator and electrosurgical devices) is designed to create

Description coagulative necrotic lesions in soft tissue, and allow localized delivery of fluid to
the lesion. The RF Generator is specifically designed for use with RITA
Electrosurgical Devices (Accessories). The RF Generator provides multiple
temperature sensors, impedance, and power monitoring to assist the user in
delivering the desired energy to the target tissue. The electrosurgical devices
consist of monopolar electrosurgical devices that include disposable electrosurgical
probes with deployable needle arrays that deliver RF power with temperature and
impedance monitoring to ablate predictable volumes of tissue.

Performance Bench studies were conducted to determine the effect the bone environment has on

Data ablation characteristics and to determine ablation parameters. Clinical studies were
conducted to determine the safety and effectiveness of the RITA System for the
ablation of painful bone lesions in order to alleviate pain. All of the studies were
conducted on patients with lesions that had metastasized to one or more locations
in the skeleton. The RITA System was used in patients who had failed
conventional therapies (e.g., analgesics, radiation therapy). Effectiveness was
measured using an instrument validated for evaluating cancer pain. From baseline
to week four, 75% and 80% patients experienced at least a two-point reduction is
worst pain and average pain respectively. The ablation procedure had low
attendant morbidity (no reports of death related to use of the devices) and three
adverse events potentially related to RF ablation.

Dear Ms. Mazzone:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for
use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce
prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good
manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be
found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish
further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or
any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with
all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807);
labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality
systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation
control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
