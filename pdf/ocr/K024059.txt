Device Description:
The Soring GmbH MBC™ Series is a monopolar and bi-polar RF surgical device for
cutting and coagulation. RF Surgery is the use of high frequency alternating electrical
current (frequency higher then 300 kHz) with the purpose of alteration or destruction of
cells and for cutting tissue. The Soring GmbH MBC™ Series is used for tissue removal
and cauterization in connection with mechanical operation techniques. The tissue
cauterization and cutting effects are accomplished by a combination of heating through
the electrical resistance offered by the biological tissue and through the heating of the
electrode. Heat production is mainly a result of the fact that biological tissue acts as an
electrical resistor for frequencies normally used during RF surgery and that as an
electrical resistor biological tissue heats up when electric currents flow through.
The amount of heat developed is therefore dependent on the current and the resistance
of the conductor (the biological tissue) put up by the patient. From an electrical point of
view, the patient is the conductor. As a result, in a closed current loop of metallic
conductors and biological tissue of equal cross sectional area the biological tissue
heats up significantly more. As can be seen in the table below, different biological
tissue types offer a wide range of electrical resistance and thus are affected differently

by the applied RF signal. The Soring GmbH MBC™ Series internal circuitry

automatically senses the resistivity and adjusts the RF signal accordingly for the best

results.

Indications for Use:
The devices are intended to cut and or coagulate (soft) biological tissue during
surgical procedures. Typical users of this system are trained medical
professionals.

Performance Data:
The subject and predicate devices both use standard data communications
controls to detect errors. Both devices comply with IEC 950 — Safety of
Information Technology Equipment, CISPR 22, class A — Electromagnetic

’ Compatibility, IEC-801-2, IEC-801-3 — Electromagnetic Compatibility, IEEE

1003.1 — General Electrical Safety for medical devices, IEC 601-1 —Electrical
Safety for medical devices using RF-power, IEC 601-2-2 ~ Special specifications
for the safety of RF-surgery units

Conclusion:
Similar to the predicate device, the Soring GmbH MBC™ Series of devices do
not control any life sustaining functions or services, The Soring GmbH MBC™
Series and the predicate device share the same conformance to performance
standards and both function as RF surgery units. Based on the information
supplied in this 510(k), we conclude that the subject devices are safe, effective,
and substantially equivalent to the predicate devices.

Dear Mr. Aletto: ,
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class If (Special Controls) or class IIT (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 - Mr. Carl Aletto
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Additionally, for questions on the
promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 5944639. Also, please note the regulation entitled, “Misbranding by reference to premarket
notification” (21CFR Part 807.97) you may obtain. Other general information on your
responsibilities under the Act may be obtained from the Division of Small Manufacturers,
International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597
