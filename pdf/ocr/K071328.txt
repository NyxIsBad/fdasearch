Description of Device

The Visualase Thermal Therapy System comprises four devices: a laser energy source,
a cooled laser applicator, a pump for circulating coolant through the applicator, and a computer
workstation with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis software for determination and
visualization of relative changes in tissue temperature during therapy.

The four components have themselves been previously cleared for marketing via 510(k)
notifications with the new device bringing these four components into a singte portable cart for
use in MR-guided laser thermal therapy procedures. In practice, all of the devices are used
according to their approved indications for use. That is, the laser applicator is introduced into the
tissue to be destroyed and connected to both the laser energy source and the cooling pump. The

Visualase Thermal Therapy System 510(k) Submission Page 10 of 139

cooling pump and laser are operated as normal to deliver energy and cause tissue ablation.
Since the laser applicator is MR-compatible, the laser ablation procedure may be carried out
inside of an MRI magnet. In this case, appropriate MR imaging can be performed during the
treatment, and the MR analysis software can be used to evaluate the thermal changes in the
target tissue. For example, the Visualase system can process real and imaginary image data
from gradient recalled echo sequences using proton resonance-frequency (PRF) shift analysis
and image subtraction to relate changes in complex phase angle back to relative changes in
tissue temperature during therapy. Thus, the laser thermal therapy procedure can be performed
under MR image guidance.

It is important to note that the functions and uses of the constituent components of the
Visualase Thermal Therapy System remain unchanged from their currently approved labeling and
indications statements. In particular, the operation of the ENVISION analysis software provides
passive monitoring of the laser treatment, and the operation of the laser, applicator, and pump
are independent of the MR imaging. The combination of these devices into a single system,
however, provides a convenience to the user who will perform laser thermal therapy treatments
under MR image guidance. Thus, the indications for use statement for the combined system now
describes that the system may be used for laser thermal therapy treatments under magnetic
resonance imaging guidance.

Indications for Use

The Visualase Thermal Therapy System is indicated for use to necrotize or coagulate soft
tissue through interstitial irradiation or thermal therapy under magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
guidance in medicine and surgery in cardiovascular thoracic surgery (excluding the heart and the
vessels in the pericardial sac), dermatology, ear-nose-throat surgery, gastroenterology, general
surgery, gynecology, head and neck surgery, neurosurgery, plastic surgery, orthopedics,
pulmonology, radiology, and urology, for wavelengths 800nm through 1064nm.

When therapy is performed under MRI guidance, and when data from compatible MR!
sequences is available, the Visualase system can process images to determine relative changes
in tissue temperature during therapy. The image data may be manipulated and viewed ina
number of different ways, and the values of data at ceriain selected points may be monitored
and/or displayed over time.

When interpreted by a trained physician, this device provides information that may be
useful in the determination or assessment of thermal therapy. Patient management decisions
should not be made solely on the basis of Visualase analysis.

Comparison to Predicate Devices

The Visualase Thermal Therapy System indications for use are the same as those of the
individual components except that, when used together as a system, the laser thermal treatment
may be performed under MRI guidance.

Non-clinical Performance Tests

Performance and technical data for each of the components of the Visualase Thermal
Therapy System are unchanged from those listed in the original submissions and are therefore
not included here.

Conclusion

The Visualase Thermal Therapy System is substantially equivalent to predicate devices. .
The combination of the devices into a system does not affect the specifications, functions, or
performance of any of the individual devices.

Dear Mr. Fox:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
(240) 276-3150 or the Internet address http://www. fda.gov/cdrh/industry/support/index.html.
