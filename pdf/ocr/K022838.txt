Device Trade Names : Fotona Dualis™” Er:YAG/KTP Laser System

Common Name : Combination of Long Pulse Er: YAG and KTP Lasers
Classification Name: Instrument, Surgical, Powered, Laser

21 CFR 878-48
II. Description
The Fotona DualisS” laser system is based on the Er: YAG (2940 nm) and KTP (532 nm)
laser technology. It is modification to combine two lasers into one housing. The
unmodified devices are the Fotona Fidelis Er:YAG laser and the Fotona Dualis\’ KTP
laser system. There are two optical cavities containing the KTP and Er:YAG crystals.
Both are activated by means of the use of flashlamps. After each cavity, a red diode
aiming beam is reflected onto a coaxial beam path using a beamsplitter assembly. The
combined therapeutic and aiming beams are guided:
° In case of the KTP laser through an optical fiber delivery system to a focusing

handpiece.
° In case of the Er: YAG laser through articulated arm to a focusing handpiece.
Both lasers share a common power supply, control system, and cooling system. The
internal computer can be directed to select either the Er:YAG laser source or the KTP
laser source. When the laser is first turned on the physician is able to select the desired
wavelength via control panel.
III. Intended Use
The Fotona DualisSY KTP laser is intended for incision, ablation, vaporization,
coagulation, and hemostasis of vascular lesions and soft tissue in various surgical areas.
All soft tissue.is included, such as skin, cutaneous tissue, subcutaneous tissué, striated
and smooth tissue, muscle, cartilage meniscus, mucous membrane, lymph vessels and
: nodes, organs, and glands.

The Fotona DualisSY Er: YAG laser is indicated for incision/excision, cutting, ablation,
vaporization, and coagulation of soft and hard tissue in various surgical areas.

IV. Summary of Substantial Equivalence

Fotona believes that its Dualis®” laser system is substantially equivalent to the Fotona .
Dualis’” long pulse KTP laser system previously cleared for incision, ablation,
vaporization, coagulation, and hemostasis of vascular lesions and soft tissue in various
surgical areas, and to the Fotona Fidelis Er:YAG laser system previously cleared for
incision/excision, cutting, ablation, vaporization, and coagulation of soft and hard tissue

in various surgical areas.

They therefore have the same Intended Use as the Fotona Dualis®” laser system.

The Dualis®” Er:YAG/KTP laser system shares the same design features (wavelength,
active medium, cooling system, power supply, beam deliveries, controls, housing) as the
predicate devices. The output characteristics are the same as those of tae predicate
devices.

The risk and benefits for the Dualis®” laser system are comparable to the predicate
devices when used for similar clinical applications.
It is therefore believed that there are no new questions of Safety or Effectiveness raised :
by the introduction of the Dualis®Y Er:YAG/KTP laser system.

Dear Sir or Madam:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for
use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce
prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good
manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class H (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply
with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part
807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the

: : _ Page 2 — Sir or Madam . : . : :
quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product :
radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Additionally, for questions on the promotion
