Device Description
The device consists of a pre-shaped curved microwave antenna which is
contained within a delivery cannula. The electrode is attached to a handle
mechanism that deploys the antenna into the targeted tissue. The
electrode comes with a connector that can be attached to a standard RF
electrosurgical generator to assist in deployment of the curved microwave
antenna into tissue. Once the curved antenna is fully deployed, the RF
connector can be removed and the remaining microwave cable is connected
to the Vivant VivaWave™ Microwave Generator. The microwave energy is
then transmitted to the curved antenna which heats the tissue within and
around the antenna.

Materials
All patient contact materials used in the manufacture of the Loop™
Microwave Ablation Probe are suitable for this use and have been used
in numerous previously cleared products.

Summary of Substantial Equivalence
The Loop™ Microwave Ablation Probe is equivalent to the predicate
products. The indications for use, basic overall function, methods of
manufacturing, and materials used are substantially equivalent.
Vivant Medical believes the Loop™ Microwave Ablation Probe is
substantially equivalent to existing legally marketed devices.
