Device description: Soft tissue ablators are radiofrequency (RF) surgical tools designed for
removal and dissection of tissue in arthroscopic surgeries. A generator or
controller serves as the power unit. Soft tissue ablators are available in a
wide range of sizes and angles; some models include thermal or suction
functions.

Intended use: Reprocessed Soft Tissue Ablators are intended to remove soft tissue and
control bleeding by providing tissue ablation and coagulaiton utilizing
high-frequency electrical current in patients requiring general or
arthroscopic surgery.

Indications Reprocessed soft tissue ablators are to be used in patients requiring

statement: arthroscopic surgery of the knee, shoulder, ankle, hip, wrist and elbow
to resect, ablate and excise soft tissue.

Technological The design, materials, and intended use of the Reprocessed Soft Tissue

characteristics: Ablators are identical to the predicate devices. The mechanism of action
of the Reprocessed Soft Tissue Ablator is identical to the predicate
devices in that the same standard mechanical design, materials, shapes
and sizes are utilized. There are no changes to the claims, intended use,
clinical applications, patient population, performance specifications, or
method of operation. :

Performance data: Bench and laboratory testing was conducted to demonstrate
performance (safety and effectiveness) of the Reprocessed Soft Tissue

. Ablators.
e Biocompatibility
e Validation of reprocessing
e Function test(s)
Performance testing demonstrates that Reprocessed Soft Tissue
Ablators perform as originally intended.

Conclusion: In accordance with the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act 21 CFR
Part 807 and based on the information provided in this premarket
notification, Alliance Medical Corporation concludes that the modified
device (the Reprocessed Soft Tissue Ablator) is safe, effective and
substantially equivalent to the predicate devices as described herein.

Dear Mr. Selvey:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and we have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the
indications for use stated in the enclosure) to devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to
May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have
been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the F ‘ederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
(Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices,
~ good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-4050.

Page 2 # Mr. Don Selvey ,
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801 and
additionally 21 CFR Part 809.10 for in vitro diagnostic devices), please contact the Office of
Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Additionally, for questions on the promotion and advertising of
your device, please contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4639. Also, please note the
regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97).
