§10(k) Premarket Submission — Mcdtronic, Inc. - Cardioblate™ System
Device Description: The Medtronic® Cardioblate® Bipolar Radiofrequecy Ablation
System is made of bipolar Surgical Ablation Device (Model
60821 & 60822) and a Cardioblate® (Bipolar & Monopolar)
Surgical Ablation Generator & accessories (Model 60890) for the
application of radiofrequency cnergy to tissue.
The Medtronic® Cardioblate® BP (Bipolar) Surgical Ablation
Device, (Model 60821 & 60822) is a hand-held, bipolar,
radiofrequency surgical ablation device.
The Medtronic® Cardioblate® (Bipolar & Monopolar) Surgical
Ablation Generator, (Model 60890) is capable of delivering the
controled radiofrequency energy for Bipolar or Monopolar
surgical ablation. The Generator delivers in Bipolar mode up to 40
Watts, with a 20 — 350 Ohm range, and a Monopolar mode up to
50 Watts to the delivery device with a 20-500 Ohm range.
Intended Uses: The Medtronic Cardioblate System is intended to ablate sofi tissue
during general surgery using radiofrequency energy.
Contraindications: The Cardioblate® BP Surgical Ablation Device should not be used
for patients that have:
Active endocarditis at time of surgery.
Ablation in a pool of blood (e.g., through a purse string
suture on a beating heart). Effects of this type of ablation
are unknown.
Nonclinical The performance characteristics of the Medtronic Cardioblate
Performance: System were tested and compared to the performance
specifications of the listed predicate devices through both bench
testing and non-bench analyses.
Substantial For the intended use listed above, the Medtronic Cardioblate
Equivanlence System is considered substantially equivalent to the listed
Conclusion: _ predicate devices. The differences that do exist are believed to be
minor and not raise any concem regarding the overall safety and
effectiveness.

Dear Mr. Cundy:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
: and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
: You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class TI (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may

CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
