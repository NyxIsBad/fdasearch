510(k) SUMMARY
Contact Name: Maneta Lollar, Director of Regulatory Affairs and Quality
Assurance
Name of Device: :
Proprietary Name: Surginetics AdvantageBlade™
Classification Name: Electrosurgical Electrodes
Classification: Class II, Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation device and
accessories, General and plastic surgery (21 CFR
878.4400)
Product Code: GE]
Intended Use
The Surginetics AdvantageBlade is intended as an alternative to uncoated
stainless steel as well as coated electrodes for use in conventional monopolar
electrosurgical accessories. The AdvantageBlade is intended for use in situations
where monopolar electrosurgery is used.
Product Description
The Surginetics AdvantageBlade is a coated blade intended for use as a
monopolar electrosurgical accessory. The blade reduces the smoke emitted into
the surgical area, uses lower wattages with less tissue damage and the coating
provides a surface that facilitates ease of cleaning of tissue residues that may
accumulate during use. The coating provides for ease of eschar cleaning.
The blades are intended for use with monopolar electrosurgical accessories and
will be packaged separately. The coated blades will also fit in currently marketed
electrosurgical pencils offered by other manufacturers.

Statement of Substantial Equivalence
Surginetics AdvantageBlade is substantially equivalent in function and intended
use to the following legally marketed devices:

1. Valleylab Uncoated E1551X
2. Valleylab Coated E1450X EDGE

For additional information see the information in Tables 1, A3-1, and A3-2.

Safety and Performance

1, Biocompatibility Testing
The biological safety of the Surginetics AdvantageBlade has been assured through
the selection of materials which demonstrate appropriate levels of
biocompatibility. The components of the blades have incidental short term
contact with patient tissues at the surgical site.

2. Performance Testing
Performance testing was performed on prototype Surginetics AdvantageBlade
electrodes. The configuration is representative of the range of electrodes that will
be available in coated form.
Testing that adjusted the power from an electrosurgical generator (a Valleylab
Force FX) until a particular blade cut effectively was used to obtain most of the
performance data. This test, which is called a Titrated Power Test because it
adjusts the power until effective cutting occurs, was used to determine the power
level at which effective cutting occurred, the amount of delay and drag during
cutting, the amount of smoke produced, the amount of eschar accumulated, and
the amount of tissue damage. The tissue sample used was fresh beef liver (about
six hours old). Beef liver is used because its consistency and size enables high
quality comparisons.
Another test, the Insulation Penetration Test, carefully placed a sharp penetrator
on the insulated surface of a coated blade and then periodically increased the load
on the penetrator and measured the time until the penetrator pushed through the
insulating coating and contacted the underlying metal blade.

e Electrode low power cutting

The Surginetics AdvantageBlade starts cutting effectively at lower power than the
predicate uncoated and coated blades. Refer to Table A3-1 for the test data.

e Initial delay/drag
The Surginetics AdvantageBlade produced less drag at startup than the predicate
uncoated and coated blades. Refer to Table A3-1 for the test data.

e Electrode smoke plume production
The Surginetics AdvantageBlade produced less smoke than the predicate
uncoated and coated blades. Refer to Table A3-1 for the test data.

e Electrode eschar accumulation
The Surginetics AdvantageBlade produced less eschar than the predicate uncoated
and coated blades. Refer to Table A3-1 for the test data.

e Tissue damage
The Surginetics AdvantageBlade produced less tissue damage than the predicate
uncoated and coated blades. Refer to Table A3-1 for the test data.

e Coating penetration
The Surginetics AdvantageBlade demonstrated better mechanical integrity when
subjected to mechanical penetration forces than the predicate coated blades. This
characteristic is not germane for uncoated blades. Refer to Table A3-2 for the test
data.

Some of the differences in the test results are large enough that it may appear that errors
exist. That is not the case. Noticeable differences exist in the results. For example, the
Delay/Drag score for Valleylab E1450X EDGE Blade #1 is 200 because that blade had
more drag during both of the cuts made with it. Similarly, both Valleylab blades

produced clouds of smoke and caused tissue damage (dark brown cooked tissue
appearance) and the AdvantageBlade devices did not produce any smoke and left the
tissue looking as if it had been cut with a sharp steel scalpel. Similar differences were
noted in the Eschar scores.

The Delay/Drag scores for the AdvantageBlade electrodes are low because the blades
gave the distinct impression of gliding through the tissue. The other blades produced
delays at the start of cutting or dragged, or both.

The insulation penetration tests were carried out with meticulous care when the
penetrator (an 18 gauge x 1.5 inch Monoject needle) was placed on the surface of the
insulation of each blade. For example, the test fixture was configured so that it was never
moved after the needle was positioned on the blade. This technique was used to prevent
vibrating or otherwise causing motions that would induce the tip of the needle to work its
way into the insulation and toward the metal portion of the blade. In spite of this great
care, all of the Valleylab E1450X EDGE blades failed as soon as the tests started. The
test results show the time being 0.1 seconds. That is the shortest time interval that the
apparatus can measure. The weight of the needle and container above it that accumulates
weight during the test run is 7.3 grams. Therefore, a time to failure of 0.1 seconds and a
weight of 7.3 grams means that the needle’s tip with no added weight penetrated the
insulation within the few seconds it took to place the penetrator on the blade’s surface
and start the timer.

Dear Ms. Lollar:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
