Substantial Equivalence
This Special 510(k) proposes to modify the performance specifications and labeling for
the Electrosurgery System, which was previously cleared in K020557 on March 21,

and sterilization parameters of the entire Electrosurgery System remain the same as in the
predicate cleared 510(k).

The addition of the ArthroCare Timer to the Electrosurgery System, as described in this
Special 510(k), is substantially equivalent to the predicate devices. The proposed
addition of the ArthroCare Timer performance specifications and labeling are not
substantial changes or modifications, and do not significantly affect the safety or efficacy
of the System.

Dear Ms. Defiesta-Ng:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
: You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class I (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may

CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
