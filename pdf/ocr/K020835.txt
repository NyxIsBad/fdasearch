Technological Characteristics

The Ceralas D10-60 Diode Laser and the predicate devices operate with a
power range of 1-60W in the CW or pulsed mode.
Substantial Equivalence

The new Ceralas D10-60 has the exact same intended use as the

cleared Ceralas D10-60 and the Diomed Laser and the same indications as the
combination of Ceralas D10-60 and Diomed Laser. The new Ceralas D10-60 also
have the same technological characteristics as the cleared Ceralas D10-60 and very
similar technological characteristics as the Diomed Laser. The minor technological
differences between the new Ceralas D10-60 and the Diomed Laser raise no new
questions of safety or effectiveness. Thus, the new Ceralas D10-60 is substantially
equivalent. :

Dear Mr. Kahan:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device

been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
(Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices,
good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
