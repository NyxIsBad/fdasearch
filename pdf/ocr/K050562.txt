Predicate Devices
The OcuLight GL/GLx laser systems are substantially equivalent to other currently
legally marketed ophthalmology laser devices including GeuLight SU/‘SEx-laser—
systems and the Lumenis Novus Spectra (K022327).
Device Description
The OcuLight GL/GLx is a semiconductor-based laser that delivers true continuous
wave green laser (532 nm) light for the indication of retinal photocoagulation, laser
trabeculoplasty, the treatment of vascular and pigmented skin lesions, and other laser
treatments. Visible red (630-650 nm) semiconductor diode laser is used for aiming.

rosose2Intended Use
The OcuLight GL/GLx is indicated for retinal photocoagulation, laser trabeculoplasty,
iridotomy, iridoplasty, the treatment of vascular and pigmented skin lesions,
stapedotomy, stapedectomy, and other ear, nose, and throat (ENT) applications. The
following are examples of applications for the OcuLight GL/GLx laser systems.

Technological Characteristics and Substantial Equivalence

The OcuLight GL/GLx is indicated for retinal photocoagulation, laser trabeculoplasty,
iridotomy, iridoplasty, the treatment of vascular and pigmented skin lesions,
stapedotomy, stapedectomy, and other ENT applications. The expansion of the
indications for use for the proposed OcuLight does not result in a change to the
hardware or firmware for the currently marketed OcuLight GL/GLx.

The OcuLight SL/SLx Laser Systems are indicated for Retinal Photocoagulation,
Laser Trabeculoplasty, Transscleral Cyclophotocoagulation (TSCPC), Transscleral
Retinal Photocoagulation (TSRPC), Iridotomy, and Iridoplasty. The OcuLight
SL/SLx diode laser systems feature a combination of pulsed diode laser and optical
fiber technology to deliver the correct balance of 810 nm wavelength, spot size, and
pulse duration for effective laser photocoagulation.

The Lumenis Novus Spectra Diode Laser System is indicated for many Ophthalmic,
Ears, Nose and Throat (including stapedectomy), Dermatological and Dentistry
applications. The Lumenis Novus Spectra delivers the same 532nm wavelength,
pulses of equivalent duration, treatment spots of equivalent size, and energy densities
equivalent to the OcuLight GL/GLx.

None
Clinical performance Data

Conclusion
The OcuLight GL/GLx is substantially equivalent to the predicate devices currently
legally marketed for stapedotomy, stapedectomy, and other ENT applications as shown
in the Indications for Use statement.

Dear Mr. Jossy: ,
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
if your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition. FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 827-8910. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
