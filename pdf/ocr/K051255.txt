The LumiPhase-R ™ is indicated for treatment of wrinkles,
rhytids and fine lines in the periorbital region.
a
Nonclinical
Performance
The LumiPhase-R was tested and complies with IEC 60825-1
Laser Safety Testing. The LumiPhase-R will comply with IEC
60601-1-2 and CAN/CSA c22.2, No. 601.1-M90.
In vitro testing and bench testing was performed and determined to
be acceptable. Based upon an analysis of the overall performance
characteristics for the device, Opusmed Inc. believes that no
significant differences exist. Therefore, the LumiPhase-R raises no
new issues of safety or effectiveness.

Clinical

Performance Clinical studies were conducted to provide assurance that
the performance of the device is equivalent to the predicate
devices. Results were acceptable and did not raise any new
issues of safety and effectiveness.

Conclusion By definition, a device is substantially equivalent when the
device has the same intended use and the same
technological characteristics as the predicate device, or has
the same intended use and different technological
characteristics. But, it can be demonstrated that the device
is as safe and effective as the predicate device and the new
device does not raise different questions regarding safety
and effectiveness as compared to the predicate device.

The differences between the Opusmed LuminPhase-R and
the predicate devices cited do not raise any different
questions regarding safety and effectiveness.
The LumiPhase-R device, as designed, is as safe and
effective as the predicate devices, and the device is
determined to be substantially equivalent to the referenced
predicate devices.

Dear Mr. Gordon:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA),
it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations 1ffecting your device
can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA
may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

device to proceed to the market.
