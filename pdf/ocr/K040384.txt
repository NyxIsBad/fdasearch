2. Names
Device Nate: MYDON C
Classification Name: Laser Instrument, Surgical Powered
Product Code: GEX
Panel: Dermatology and Plastic Surgery
3. Predicate Devices
The MYDON C laser system is substantially equivalent to the Altus Medical
CoolGlide Aesthetics Laser (K023954), the Laserscope Lyra Surgical Laser System
(K020021), the Fotona DUALIS XP Plus Nd:YAG Laser System (K022839) and the
Adept Medical Concepts 1064/532 Laser (K032220).
4. Device Description
The MYDON C is a 1064 nm solid-state long-pulsed Nd:YAG laser system. The
beam is directed to the treatment area by a transmission system which is connected
to the laser device and consists of a multifunction hose system and a tightly
connected hand unit. In the multifunction hose system both laser radiation carrying
quartz fiber as well as the cooling and signal leads are contained. The MYDON C
transmission system includes skin cooling integrated into the hand unit and cools the
area of skin that the laser covers. When the applicator is placed against the skin, its

shape and the integrated hand unit cooling system cool the treatment area before,

during and after the application of the laser pulse, all in a single step.

The hand unit inserts allow for various treatment types and parameter ranges.

MYDON C offers the 1.5 and 3 mm hand unit inserts specifically for the treatment

of vascular lesions, the 5 mm hand unit insert for the treatment of both vascular

lesions and wrinkles, the 7 mm and 10 mm hand unit inserts for hair removal.
5. Indications for Use

The MYDON C laser system is indicated:

1. For the coagulation and hemostasis of benign vascular lesions such as, but not
limited to, port wine stains, hemangiomas, warts, telangiectasia, rosacea, venus
lake, leg veins, and spider veins.

2. The MYDON C laser system is also indicated for the treatment of wrinkles.

3. The MYDON C is also indicated for the removal of unwanted hair and for the
treatment of pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB).

4. The MYDON C laser system is indicated for use on all skin types (Fitzpatrick IVD, including tanned skin.

5, The intended use of the integral cooling system in the MYDON C laser
handpiece is to provide cooling of the skin prior to laser treatment, for the
reduction of pain during laser treatment, to allow for the use of higher fluences
for laser treatments such as hair removal and vascular lesions, and to reduce the
potential side effects of laser treatments.

6. Performance Data
