3. Predicate device: K894166 — RDM Thermosurgery™ Localized Current Field
RF Instrument

Product code / Regulation no.: GEI / 878.4400/Classil

4. Description of device: The TTI ThermoMed device delivers controlled localized
current field (LCF) radio frequency (RF) heat to selectively
destroy certain diseased tissue. RF energy is delivered to
the dermal surface via a hand held wand with an
autoclaveable energy applicator. For convenience, an
audial and visual signal indicates the elapsed treatment
time in 30-second intervals after the selected target
temperature is reached.

5. Intended Use: The device is intended to treat benign superficial
dermatological indications that includes; warts, molluscum
contagiosm, angioma, fibroma, seborrheic keratoses, :

: acrochordon, syringoma, hydrocystoma, clavus, actinic
keratoses, keloids, epidermoid cysts, cystic acne,
cutaneous leishmaniasis, atypical mycobacteria, and
dermatophytosis.

Treatment of patients with implanted electronic devices,
patients with metallic implants and pregnant women is
contraindicated.

6. Technological comparison: This Special 510(k) device modification is submitted to
provide notification of a change in the temperature
controller from analog to digital control. No negative
effects on safety or effectiveness have been found after the
risk analysis and risk mitigation process. This change is
rated as a “minor level of concern” per the May 1998
software guidance.

CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
