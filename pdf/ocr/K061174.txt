Description of the Device
The Surgi-Max Electrosurgery Generator is a compact source of high radio-frequency RF energy to be
employed for a variety of radiosurgery procedures. This action is achieved by front panel selection of
._ waveforms and power level. All selection is effected through push buttons and lamps, which give the
operator feedback of status.
Power level for each mode is indicated by front panel digital displays, which also show the status of
self-test and monitoring. The display is interlocked with controls to prevent operation when FAIL is
displayed. The final output power control is made through foot and/or hand switches. Both Monopolar
and Bipolar electrodes are offered. :
The power output in the CW (Cut) mode is 120 watts into (500 ohms) a matched load. The output
frequency is maintained at 4.0 MHz +/- 400Hz over all service and loading conditions including short
and open for monopolar mode. .
Three output waveforms are provided:
CW CUT - Continuous wave output with average power equal to the maximum with no deliberate
modulation.
CUT / COAG - Deeply modulated envelope with average to peak power ratio approximately 50%.
Modulation occurring at 120 or 100 Hz rate.
HEMO - Deeply modulated wave with average to peak ratio approximately 50%. Modulation
occurring at 120 or 100 Hz rate of square wave.

Dear Dr. Garito:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments. or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food. Drug.
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices. good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
{f your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class HI] (PMA). it
