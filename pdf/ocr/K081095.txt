D. Device Description [21 CFR 807.92(a)(4)]
The ProLite I IPL is a device designed for dermatological use. It produces an
intense light pulse within the wavelengths of 450 to 2000 nanometers, which is
tailored to specific indications by a bandpass filter. The system is composed of a
Tower which encloses the power supply and cooling system and a Handpiece which
contains the flash lamp, filter and waveguide. The device is controlled by a touchscreen graphic user interface.
E. Device Specifications [21 CFR 807.92(a)(6)]
The ProLite HI IPL outputs a flash with selectable pulse durations of 5 to 120
milliseconds with a shot fluence adjustable in the range of 5-30 J/om?. The maximal
repetition rate is 1 shot per second. The photorejuvenation “PR” handpieces output
the spectrum from 530 to 1100 nm, 550-1100 nm, or 580-1100 nm using a userinaccessible bandpass filter. The hair removal “HR” handpieces output the spectrum
from 630 to 990 nm, 630 to 1100 nm, or 650 to 1100 nm using a user inaccessible
bandpass filter. The waveguide area is 6 cm* (1.5 x4 cm). The waveguide is cooled
by thermo-electric “Peltier” devices with the temperature setpoint adjustable from
room temperature to 5°C.
F. Indications for Use [21 CFR 807.92(a)(5)]
The ProLite 111™ Pulsed Light System with the HR handpiece (containing a 630: 1100 nm, 630-990 nm, or 750 — 1100 nm filter) is intended for the removal of
unwanted hair in all Fitzpatrick skin types. .
The ProLite 11™ Pulsed Light System with the PR handpiece (containing a 5301100 nm, 550-1100 nm, or 580-1100 nm filter) is intended for the treatment of
benign pigmented lesions and the removal of tattoos, the treatment of vascular
lesions, and the treatment of shallow veins, telangiectasia, facial hemangiomas, and
rosacea vascular lesions.
G. Conclusion [21 CFR 807.92(b)(3)]
Technologically, the ProLite IIT was found to be substantially equivalent to the
currently cleared ProLite (K021303) and Dermalux (K021304). Thus, the risks and
benefits for the ProLite If are comparable to the predicate devices. ,
The indications for use are exactly the same as the previously cleared pulsed light
system, the ProLite (K021303).
We believe that there are no new questions of safety or efficacy raised by the
introduction of the ProLite IT.

Dear Dr. Johnson: ,
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration. /
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
, be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcenients concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050:

Page 2 — Michael Johnson, M.D.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
Hf you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health's (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
_ premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474, For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the i
