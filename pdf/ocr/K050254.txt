2. Names
Device Name: Spectra-SP Laser System
Classification Name: Laser Instrument, Surgical Powered
Product Code: GEX
Panel: Dermatology and Plastic Surgery
3. Predicate Devices
The Spectra-SP Laser System is substantially equivalent to a combination of the
Lumenis Family of UltraPulse SurgiTouch CO2 Laser Systems (K030147), the
Lumenis UltraPulse Encore Carbon Dioxide Surgical Lasers and Delivery Device
Accessories (K022060), the Lumenis Compact 20C, 30C and 40C CO2 Lasers
(K935563 and K963229), the ESC Medical Systems Luxar LX-20 CO2 Surgical
Laser System Family (K991628 and K960475), and the MedArt Uni-Laser 450P
CO2 Laser System & Accessories (K991297).
4. Device Description
The Spectra-SP Laser System consists of a self-contained console, an articulated
arm delivery system, a footswitch and a pair of goggles. The Spectra-SP Laser
C0001:

produces a beam of coherent infrared (10.6,um) and has dual operation mode.
(Continuous Wave & Char-Free)
The main console is the heart of the Spectra-SP Laser and contains the optical
system (with DC-Excited Sealed-off Carbon Dioxide GAS Tube), cooling system,
arm mount, micro-controller, and power supply. The main console also includes a
key switch used to turn the power on and off, an emergency stop push button that
quickly de-energizes the system in emergency situations, and the control panel.
There are 4 casters in the console base for moving.
The laser beam exits an articulated arm into a handpiece where it is focused by
the final focus lens contained in the handpiece to produce a spot size at the
treatment focal plane. The handpiece components, when inserted in the beam
delivery system, change the laser beam characteristics.
5. Indications for Use
The Spectra-SP Laser System is indicated for use in surgical applications
requiring the ablation, vaporization, excision, incision, and coagulation of soft
tissue in medical specialties including: dermatology, plastic surgery, podiatry,
neurosurgery, gynecology, otorhinolaryngology (ENT), arthroscopy, (knee), and
open endoscopic general surgery.
Dermatology & Plastic Surgery

surgery for the reduction, removal, and/or treatment of actinic keratosis, skin tags,
solar/actinic elastosis, actinic cheilitis, lentigines, uneven
pigmentation/dyschromia, acne scars, surgical scars, keloids, hemangiomas
(including buccal hemangiomas) tattoos, telangiectasia, squamous and basal cell
carcinoma, spider and epidermal naevi, xanthelasma palpebrarum, syringoma, and
verrucae and seborrhoecae vulgares (warts); laser derm-ablation; and laser burn
debridement.
Dermatology, Plastic Surgery & General Surgery

surgery, including the performance of blepharoplasty and for the creation of
recipient sites for hair transplantation, treatment of hemorrhoids, atheroma, cysts,
abscesses, and all other soft tissue applications.
Soft Tissue Dental
The specific soft tissue dental indications include: Periodontic procedures such as
gingivectomy-removal of hyperplasias, gingivoplasty, and incision and excision,
v00013

Oral surgery such as frenectomy, incisional and excisional biopsy, incision and
excision of aphous ulcers, incision of infection when used with antibiotic therapy,
excision and ablation of benign and malignant lesions, homeostatis,
operculectomy, and crown lengthening.
Podiatry
Laser ablation, vaporization, and/or excision of soft tissue in podiatry for the
reduction, removal, and/or treatment of verrucae vulgares, and matrixectomy.
Otorhinolaryngology (ENT)

otorhinolaryngology for the treatment of choanal atresia, leukoplakia of larynx,
nasal obstruction, UPP, rhinophyma, adult and juvenile papillomatosis polyps,
rhinophyma and verrucae vulgares.
Gynecology
Laser incision, excision, ablation and/or vaporization of soft tissue in gynecology
for the treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, condyloma acuminata,
leukoplakia (vulvar dystrophies) and vulvar and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia.
Neurosurgery
Laser incision, excision, ablation and/or vaporization of soft tissue in neurology
for the treatment of basal tumor-meningioma, posterior fossa tumors, peripheral
neurectomy, and lipomas/large tumors.

Dear Ms, O’Connell:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class I] (Special Controls) or class IN (PMA),
it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device
can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA
