Device Name: BURANE
Classification Name: Laser Instrument, Surgical Powered
Product Code: GEX
Panel: Dermatology and Plastic Surgery
3. Predicate Devices
The BURANE laser system is substantially equivalent to the AesculapMeditec MCL 29 Dermablate Laser System (K992707 and K964128), the
Domier Medilas E Laser (K981438), the Cynosure CO3 Er:YAG Laser
(K983034), the Laserscope Laser VELA (K971843), the WaveLight BURANE
XL (K050317) and the Sciton Er:YAG Laser PROFILE 3000 (KO040005).
4, Device Description
BURANE is a Er:YAG laser system for dermatological interventions and for
aesthetic laser applications. The BURANE has an Ab/ation Mode and a
Coagulation Mode. .

510(k) Summary of Safety and Effectiveness
nnn
Furthermore, the laser system enables a quick, precise ablation with minimal
thermal tissue damage. Thus an optimal wound healing process is achieved
~ the risk of scar formation is minimized. This is due to the BURANE’s
wavelength of 2.94 ym, which has an absorption maximum in water and is
therefore absorbed very well by tissue water. The thermal damage zone is
thus minimized.
While the parameter wavelength is specified by the device, spot size, laser
energy, pulse sequence, and coagulation function can be selected by the
treating physician for optima! adjustment to individual requirements.
5. Indications for Use
The BURANE is indicated:
The BURANE is intended to be used in small and large joint arthroscopy,
laparoscopic procedures, general and all surgical procedures for
incision/excision, vaporization, ablation, and coagulation of soft tissue and
cartilage. All soft tissues encountered in all surgical procedures are included
in this indication such as, skin, cutaneous tissue, subcutaneous tissue,
straited and smooth tissue, muscle, cartilage, meniscus, mucous membrane,
lymph vessels and nodes, organs and glands. The BURANE is indicated for
use in skin resurfacing. The BURANE is indicated for use in medicine and
surgery, in the following medical specialities: Dermatology, Plastic
Gastroenterology, ENT, Thoracic Surgery, Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery,
Ophtalmology & Podiatry.
Aesthetic Surge
Skin resurfacing and treatment of wrinkles.
Dermatology/Plastic Surgery
Indications include, epidermal nevi, telangiectasia, spider veins, actinic
chellitis, keloids, verrucae, skin tags, anal tags, keratoses, scar revision,
debulking benign tumors, decubitis ulcers.
Gastroenterology
General Surgery
The Er.YAG laser is intended for the surgical incision/excision, vaporization
and coagulation of soft tissue during general surgery application where skin
incision, tissue dissection, excision of external tumors and lesions, complete
or partial resection of internal organs, tumors and lesions, tissue ablation
and/or vessel coagulation.

Dear Mr. Rongero:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling. and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
