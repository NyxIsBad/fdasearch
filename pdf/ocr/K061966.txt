Summary of Clinical performance data
The safety and efficacy of Er:YAG Laser devices with wavelength of 2.94
micron and power up to 8.5 Watts is well established in scientific research
and literature including procedures performed in hard and soft oral tissue,
Endodontology and Periodontology.
Due to the comprehensive animal and clinical study performed in
scientific research and literature, and since the power, wavelength, pulse
duration and frequency of the LITETOUCH Dental Laser System are well
within the previous cleared values, Light Instruments believes that animal
and clinical studies are not required to determine the safety and efficacy
of the device.
