Technological controlled dose of high frequency energy to the vein, which
Characteristics stops the flow of blood to the area of concern. Once the
flow of blood is interrupted, the appearance of the spider
. veins is greatly reduced or eliminated. The power generator
controls the delivery of energy to the needle and creates the
impulse. The system utilizes a current of 4MHz. The impulse
can be set between 0.2 seconds and 1 second in 0.1
second increments. The power can be set between 30% and :
60% in 5% increments. Needles are purchased from Ballet
