with the requirements of SMDA 1990 and 21CFR 807.92.
1, Submitter’s Identification
Submitter's Name: MISONIX INCORPORATED
Address: 1938 New Highway, Farmingdale, NY 11735
‘Telephone Number: 516-694-9555
Contact Person: Ronald R. Manna
Date Prepared: August 22, 2005
2. Name of Device
Proprietary Name: Misonix Inc. FS-1000-RF Bipolar Forceps
Accessory
Common/Usual Name: Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation
device and accessories
Product Code: GEI
Classification: Class II
3. Predicate Device Information
Predicate Devices Boston Surgical Products Inc. Disposable Bipolar
Coagulating Forceps K942710
Olsen Electrosurgical Inc. Teflon Coated Electrodes
for Electrosurgical Handles K913108
Guenter Bissinger Medizintechnik GmbH Claris
Non Stick Bipolar Forceps K051429
4. Device Description Metal and plastic construction that approximates a
tweezer assembly. Includes provision for
connection to the output of a standard bipolar
electrosurgical generator. Also includes provision
for mechanical attachment to an ultrasonic surgical
12

aspirator. There is no energy interaction between
the ultrasound unit and the electrosurgery unit.

5. Intended Use: The Misonix Inc. FS-1000-RF Bipolar Forceps
Accessory is indicated for use in bipolar procedures
to grasp, manipulate. coagulate andor transect
tissues in the following specialities:

Neurosurgery

Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery

General Surgery
6. Comparison to Predicate Device
FS-1000-RF Bipolar Forceps Accessory is similar in design. material and operating
parameters to the Boston Surgical Products Inc. Disposable Bipolar Coagulating
Forceps. the Olsen Electrosurgical Inc. Teflon Coated Electrodes for Electrosurgical
Handles and the Guenter Bissinger Medizintechnik GmbH Claris Non Stick Bipolar
Forceps.
All devices utilize two electrodes made of metal material, usually stainless steel or
titanium. A coating of titanium oxide is used on the Misonix FS-L000-RF forceps
accessory to minimize tissue adhesion. Predicates use other coatings such as Teflon
lo accomplish the same effect.
The prongs of the forceps are held together at the proximal end by plastic assemblies
which both provide a spring action to either hold the forceps open or closed without
operator intervention. Nylon coatings insulate the prongs so that the operator is not
touching the RF energized metal, providing a measure of safety.
7. Safety and Performance Data
The Misonix Inc. FS-1000-RF Bipolar Forceps Accessory have been designed and
tested to pass the following Voluntary Standards:

9. Non-Clinical Tests Performed for Determination of Substantial Equivalence
are as follows:
Note: Forceps are passive devices. Testing was done while attached to standard
electrosurgical generator. Testing confirmed that forceps did not alter expected
output characteristics of any generator tested.

EMI Tests
Dielectric Tests on Mains Circuits
Patient Current Leakage and Patient Sink Current Measurements
Power Line Ground Leakage Measurements
Dielectric Tests on Patient Circuits
RF Cautery Life Tests
Dielectric Tests with RF Cautery Unit Attached

Temperature testing with tips closed for prolonged period of time
9. In Vitro Tests Performed
Testing of bipolar effect on animal tissue (bench top)
Temperature testing of forceps during prolonged bench testing
Surgeon assisted trial on animal tissue (bench top) for clinician
feedback
10. Conclusions
Based upon a review of the published literature and its internal
testing. Misonix Inc. can state that the use of the FS-1000-RF
Bipolar Forceps Accessory for grasping, manipulating, coagulation
and transecting tissue is safe and efficacious. We can also state
that the FS-1000-RF Bipolar Forceps Accessory is substantially
equivalent in this regard to the Boston Surgical Products Inc.
Disposable Bipolar Coagulating Forceps, the Olsen Electrosurgical

Dear Mr. Manna:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act.. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may

CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
