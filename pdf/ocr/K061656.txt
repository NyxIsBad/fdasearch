I, Device Name |
Proprietary Name: Laser-D68
Common/ Usual Name: Infrared Lamp |
Classification Name: Lamp, infrared, therapeutic heating
Regulation Number: 890.5500 |
Product Codes: ILY
Classification: 2 |
Classification Panel: Physical Medicine
Hi. Predicate Device
Laser Pain Clinics is substantially equivalent to the Eltech s.r.l K-Laser |
(K050070) and the Advanced Medical Technologies Maestro MDTL Laser
System (K053473). The devices are therapeutic medical lasers designed to
deliver light energy to the target tissue. i
IV. Intended Use of the Device
Laser-D68 System provides visible red and infrared therapy to provide topical
heating for the temporary: |
+ Increase in local blood circulation |
* Retief of minor muscles and joint aches, pains and stiffness
* Relaxation of muscles |
* Relief of muscle spasms :
« Relief of minor pain and stiffness associated with arthritis |
¥. Description of the Device
The Laser-D68 is a non-invasive, low energy infrared therapeutic medical |
laser that is intended to perform laser therapy in healthcare centers, physical |
therapy laboratories, and family doctor practices. |

PAIN CLINICS
The Laser D68 is supplied with three different probes that are used to senna
laser radiation when connected to the D68 driver unit. Probe #1 is a 660nm,
Indium Gallium Aluminum Phoshpide (InGaAIP) laser diode (visible red
light) with an adjustable treatment power output from 1 milliwatts (mW) to 50
milliwatts (mW) (in ImW increments). Probe #2 is an 830nm, Gallium
Aluminum Arsenide (GaAIAs) laser diode (infrared light) with an adjustable
treatment power output from 20 milliwatts to 400 milliwatts (in SmW
increments). Probe #3 is a 904nm, Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) laser diode
(infrared light) with adjustable treatment power output of either SmW to
90mW (in 5mW increments) (45W laser power source) or 5 mW to 150mW
(in 5 mW increment) (75W modulated laser power source).
Each of the laser probes are fully interchangeable with the D68 driver.
Vi. Summary of the Technical Characteristics for the Laser-D68 to the
referenced predicate devices.
The Laser-D68 and the aforementioned predicate devices are infrared lamps
as defined in 21 CFR 890.5500. These devices use infrared diodes to emit
invisible photonic energy to tissue. The intended use is identical for all
devices.
Vil. Testing
The testing of the Laser-D68 included electrical safety testing, laser safety
testing and electromagnetic compatibility testing.
VU. Safety & Effectiveness
There are no substantial differences between the Laser-D68 defined in this
510(k) submission and the predicate devices. They are similar to the
technologies that are currently used in other similar medical devices.
The Laser-D68 included electrical safety testing, laser safety testing and
electromagnetic compatibility testing.
The Laser-D68 meets the applicable requirements of CFR 1040.
The Laser-D68, as with the predicate devices, has been certified to the
requirements of the Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC, and is CE Mark: |

Dear Ms. Wright:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class IJ (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements conceming your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 — Ms. Holly Wright
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
