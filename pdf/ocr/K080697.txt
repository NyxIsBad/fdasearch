Description of the

Long-Pulse Nd:YAG Laser: The SKIN CLEAR SRVH Long Pulsed Nd:YAG
Laser is a compact self-contained device that
delivers a beam of laser energy at infrared
wavelengths of 1064 nm and 1320 nm to the
treatment site. The SKIN CLEAR SRVH Long
Pulsed Nd:YAG Laser consists of six (6) primary
components:
1, Laser console;
2. Internal computer;
3. Control panel and display;
4. Optical delivery system;
5. Hand set with integrated cooling (chilled sapphire
optical window);
6. Foot switch
The SKIN CLEAR SRVH Long Pulsed Nd:YAG
Laser is not battery operated, but is controlled and
operated with the aid of computer software.

Intended Use of the

Long-Pulse Nd:YAG Laser: 1064 nm: Intended for the coagulation and
hemostasis of benign vascular lesions, such as, but
not limited to, port wine stains, hemangiomas,
warts, telangiectasia, rosacea, venus lake, leg veins,
spider veins and poikiloderma of civatte; and the
treatment of benign cutaneous lesions such as warts,
scars, striae and psoriasis. The laser is also intended
for the treatment of benign pigmented lesions such
as, but not limited to, lentigos, solar lentigos, Café
au lait macules, seborrheic keratoses, nevi,
chloasma, verrucea, skin tags, keratoses, and
plaques.
The laser is also indicated for the treatment of
wrinkles such as, but not limited to, periocular and
perioral wrinkles. Additionally, the laser is
indicated for the removal of unwanted hair, for the
stable long-term, or permanent, hair reduction
through selective targeting of merlanin in hair
follicles, and for the treatment of pseudofolliculitis

barbae. Indicated for use on all skin types
(Fitzpatrick I-IV), including tanned skin.
1320 nm: For use in dermatology for incision,
excision, ablation and vaporization with hemostasis
of soft tissue. For use in the treatment of fine lines
and wrinkles. It is also indicated for the treatment of
back acne and atrophic acne scars.

Conclusion: The SKIN CLEAR SRVH Long Pulsed Nd:YAG
Laser shares the same indications for use, similar
design features (including wavelengths, laser
medium, power supply, cooling and control
systems), functional features (including power
output, repetition rate, energy, spot sizes and energy
fluence), and is therefore substantially equivalent to
the above legally marketed laser systems currently
in commercial distribution.

Dear Mr. Devine:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class I] (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
