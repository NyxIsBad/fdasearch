E. Description of Device
The proposed Smith & Nephew ElectroThermal® 20S Spine generator is a 20-watt
electrothermal generator. It is intended to be used to create lesions in nervous tissue and to
coagulate and decompress material when used in combination with Smith & Nephew
thermal/coagulating probes. The generator provides temperature and impedance monitoring
of energy to maintain effective tissue heating during temperature controlled applications.
Smith & Nephew ElectroThermal® 20S Spine generator is designed to be used in
conjunction with Smith and Nephew Spine products. These products include the Smith &
Nephew SpineCATH® Intradiscal Catheter, the Smith & Nephew Decompression Catheter
and the Smith & Nephew RF Denervation Probe and Smith & Nephew RF Probe.
F. Intended Use
The Smith & Nephew ElectroThermal® 20S Spine System is intended to create lesions in
nervous tissue, and to coagulate and decompress disc material when used in combination
with Smith & Nephew thermal/coagulating probes, The generator and accessories are
intended for use by qualified medical personnel trained in the use of electrosurgical
equipment.
Contraindications for Use:
There are no known absolute contraindications to the use of electrosurgery.
The Smith & Nephew ElectroThermal® 20S Spine System is contraindicated, when in the
judgement of the physician, an electrosurgical procedure would be contrary to the best
interest of the patient.
G. Comparison of Technological Characteristics
The Smith & Nephew ElectroThermal® 20S Spine generator is substantially equivalent to
the Smith & Nephew ORA-50 §, cleared in K993854, based on the following:
¢ Both control and monitor temperature
© Both monitor impedance
¢ Both use RF energy to thermally heat the SpineCATH® and Decompression catheters
* Both provide preset settings for time and temperature to deliver RF.
The Smith & Nephew ElectroThermal® 20S Spine generator is substantially equivalent to
the Radionic’s RFG-3C Plus Lesion Generator cleared in K982489 based on the following:
¢ Both control and monitor temperature
¢ Both monitor impedance
¢ Both use a biphasic square wave to deliver stimulation voltage

¢ Both use temperature controlled RF energy to create lesions in nervous tissue
H. Summary Performance Data
The performance testing conducted on the Smith & Nephew ElectroThermal® 208 Spine
generator demonstrates substantial equivalents to the Radionic’s RFG-3C Plus Lesion
Generator cleared in K982489 and the Smith & Nephew ORA-50 § cleared in K993854
based on deliverance of temperature and time of RF controlled energy.

Dear Ms. Haselton:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior lo May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may

or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Tederal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820), and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
