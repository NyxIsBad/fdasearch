Predicate Devices
Ceramoptec’s Fiber Optic Delivery Sytems incl. Handpieces (K923953, K943445, ‘
K942182 and K951775),
Coherent’s Fiber Optic Delivery System incl. Handpieces (K960413, K960032 and
K991258)
InnovaQuartz Fiber Optic Delivery System (K994010),
Laser Peripherals Fiber Optic Delivery System (K92272, K011207 and K030959),
Trymedyne Inc., Fiber Optic Delivery System (K973172) :
Intend of Use
The Laser peripherals bare laser fibers, ENT fibers and Endoprobes are intended for use
in laser surgical procedure for cutting, coagulating, or vaporizing in any soft tissue
application for which compatible Nd: YAG, Ho: YAG, KTP and Diode lasers have been
cleared.
Technological Characteristics and Substancial Equivalence
Fiber Optic Delivery Systems and Handpieces are intended to vaporize, coagulate, incise
and excise tissue and which are designed for any indication for which compatible laser
systems have been cleared by FDA. Similarly, the predicate devices are also components
of delivery systems designed to deliver laser radiation to a specified point.
Second, FiberTech’s Fiber Optic Delivery System’s fiber optical Handpiece and Tip has
a similar material composition as its predicate devices. Third, the Fiber Optic Delivery
System is available in sizes between 200 micron and 1000 micron.Ceramoptec’s and
Coherent Laser Delivery Systems is available also in sizes ranging from 200 micron to
1000 micron.
Fourth, the reusable and the disposable Fiber Optic Delivery Systems are available in the
same tip shapes and handpiece configurations. Further, both the reusable and the
disposable devices are prepackaged sterile and fit lasers which employ SMA 905
connectors or lasers which have suitable adapters to allow SMA 905 connectors to be
used.
Finally, the reusable Fiber Optic Delivery System can be reused only once the optical
fiber tip is properly cleaned, inspected, stripped and cleaved.
In sum, there are more or less no differences between the reusalbe and disposable fiber
optic systems whith their predicate devices. Although these differences are so extremly
minor there are no new questions of safety and effectiveness raised by the indroduction of
this devices.

Performance Data

All of the Fiber Optic Delivery Systems are CE marked in accordance with the Medical
Device Directive 93/42/EEC Annex II, Article 3. (Registration No: HD 2111863 01,
Report No: C 2113751 E 02) and are also certified under the requirements specified in
EN ISO 13485:2003 (Registration No: SX 60008740 0001) and certified for Quality
Management System according to EN ISO 9001:2000 (Registration No: SY 60008739
0001)

Dear Dr. Kaus:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class I] (Special Controls) or class III (PMA),
it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device
can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA
may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 891); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 2! CFR 1000-10590.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device-as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your
device to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
