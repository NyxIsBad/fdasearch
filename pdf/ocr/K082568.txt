DEVICE DESCRIPTION:
Predicate Devices:
TissueLink: Solid Cylinder Monopolar Device K014260
INTENDED USE:
The Resection Device is a sterile, single use electrosurgical device intended to be used in
conjunction with an electrosurgical generator for the delivery of radiofrequency (“RF”)
current and sterile saline for cutting and coagulating soft tissue.
DEVICE COMPONENTS AND OPERATION:
1) Insulated Handle:
The Insulated Handle encases the controlling mechanism for the flow of saline,
and actiyation of the: RF current for the device. :
The activation of RF current is accomplished by a single push button on the top of
the handle.
The Handle has a flow control mechanism so the flow of saline can. be regulated
by the user within the sterile field. The tubing length is approximately ten (10)
feet in length and incorporates an [.V. spike on the end to attach directly to a
hanging IV (saline) bag.
The Handle power cord is approximately ten (10) feet in length and incorporates a
3-prong electrical plug.
The insulation of the Insulated Handle and Power Cord meets the requirements
for Dielectric Withstands of Accessories.
2) Shaft and Electrode Tip:
The electrode tip delivers RF energy for cutting and coagulation and delivers
saline which is gravity-fed from an Intravenous bag to the tip.

510(k) SUMMARY (per CFR21 807.92(c)) (agp 3 4 @
These devices use technology substantially equivalent to the TissueLink Solid Cylinder
Monopolar Device (K014260). Both consist of an electrode tip that is used to cut and
coagulate tissue through the utilization of high frequency radiofrequency energy.
Resection Devices are provided sterile, sterilized using ethylene oxide gas, and are for
single use only.
The Resection Device conforms to the requirements of safety standard IEC 60601 -2-2.
There are no significant differences in technology, performance, or intended use between
the Resection Device and the given predicate device. There are no new questions raised
regarding safety or effectiveness.

Dear Mr. Kozloff:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class Il (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can :
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 — Mr. Richard Kozloff .
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at ,
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance .
