Legally Marketed
Predicate Device: The Accelawave System is substantially equivalent in terms of
technological characteristics, performance, intended use,
indications for use and operator interface to;
e Chromogenex (K053324)
e Sciton (K032460)
e Lumenis (K020839)

System Description: The Accelawave is an Intense Pulsed Light-based medical device
utilizing xenon flash lamp technology to illuminate the dermis to
offer light based therapies as listed in the indications of use. The
Accelawave emits “light at 420nm to 1200nm via a 15mm x 45mm
treatment area at a repetition rate equal to or less than 0.5Hz
(operator selective).

. *Light is delivered to the skin surface while a water-cooled heat
transfer network cools the contacting surfaces and the epidermis.

Performance The device complies with the European Medical Directive

Standards: 93/42/EEC concerning medical devices, and will comply with
voluntary standards UL60601-1:1996 when marketed in the U.S.

Indications for use: Indications for Use for Fitzpatrick skin types (I to Vl)

e The removal of unwanted hair and to effect stable long-term or *permanent hair
reduction.
*Permanent hair reduction is defined as a long-term stable reduction in the
number of hairs re-growing after a treatment regimen.

e The treatment of moderate inflammatory acne vulgaris

e The treatment of benign pigmented epidermal lesions including dyschromia,
hyperpigmentation, melasma, ephelides (freckles)

e The treatment of cutaneous lesions including warts, scars, and striae.

e The treatment of benign cutaneous vascular lesions, including port wine stains,
hemangiomas, facial, truncal and leg telangiectasias, erythema of rosacea, angiomas,
and spider angiomas, poikiloderma of civatte, leg veins and venous malformations.

The integrated thermal cooling is indicated for use in cooling the epidermis at the treatment
site prior to, during, and after treatment in general aesthetic dermatologic and plastic surgery
procedures,

« Reduce pain during and/or with light treatment (via partial anesthesia from cooling)

e Reduce discomfort during and/or associated with light treatment

e Minimize thermal injury, including thermal necrosis, to non-target skin and skin
structures during and/or associated with light treatment, thus reducing possible
complications such as scabbing, scarring, hyper — and/or hypopigmentation

e Allow the use of higher light fluences for light or laser treatments (such as for hair
removal and the treatment of vascular or pigmented lesions)

e Reduce potential side effects of light or laser treatments (such as for hair removal and
the treatment of vascular or pigmented lesions)
Conclusion: The Accelawave System is substantially equivalent to its predicate
: devices, based upon predicate similarities. The skin is treated in the same
manner as the predicate devices, Intense Pulsed Light and dermal cooling.

Side Effects: In extreme cases, effects from treatment can include excessively red
patches in the shape of the applicator head and blistering. If this occurs
the tissue should be cooled and cared for as would normally be the case
with burns to the skin, i.e. do not burst any blister formation, keep clean
and covered until healed.

. If blisters form, they are usually intra-epidermal in nature and heal without
scarring. Inappropriate management of blisters during the healing stage
will increase the chance of scarring.

Dear Mr. Conry:
This letter corrects our substantially equivalent letter of September 12, 2008.
* We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the
device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the
indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed
in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device
Amendments or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a
premarket approval (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general
controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include
requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice,
labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III
(PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your ,
device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In
addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal
Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not
mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other
requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other

Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not
limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); medical
device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good
manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21
CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions
(Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
