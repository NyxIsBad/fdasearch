Date Prepared: August 6, 2004
Common Name: Bipolar Electrosurgical Open and Laparoscopic Instruments
Trade/Proprietary Name: ERBE BiClamp™ Open and Laparoscopic Instruments
Classification Name: Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation device and accessories

(21CFR878.4400) and Gynecologic electrocautery and

accessories (21 CFR Part 884.4120)
Product Code: GEI and HG!
Legally Marketed Valleylab Inc. LigaSure™ Open and Laparoscopic
Predicate Device: Instruments, 510(k) Number: K981916
Device Description:
The ERBE BiClamp™ Open and Laparoscopic Instruments are used with an ERBE VIO
Electrosurgical Generator (ESU) System having the Optional Bipolar Mode, BiClamp. High
Frequency (HF) energy from the ESU is delivered through the jaws of the ERBE BiClamp™
Instruments to coagulate/desiccate tissue. The ERBE BiClamp™ Open Instruments are made
of stainless steel with plastic insulation except at the jaw surfaces (which isolates the energy to
only the jaw surfaces). The ERBE BiClamp™ Laparoscopic Instruments are made of metals
and plastics with the electrical energy isolated to the jaws. They have various jaw types, which
are standard in the industry. The ERBE BiClamp™ Open Instruments range in size from 200
mm (7.9 inches) to 270 mm (10.6 inches) in length with bent jaws that have a smooth surface.
The ERBE BiClamp™ Laparoscopic Instruments have a 5 mm outside diameter (O.D.) and a
340 mm (13.4 inches) working length. The Instruments are provided non-sterile and are
reusable (Note: The cleaning and sterilization processes have been validated and are provided
in the Notes on Use to the customer.).
Intended Use:
The ERBE BiClamp™ Open and Laparoscopic Instruments are intended for use in general
surgery, laparoscopic, gynecologic, urological, and thoracic procedures where fusion of vessels
or tissues is desired. The devices can be used on vessels up to 7 mm and bundles as large as
will fit in the jaws of the instrument. A vessel fusion is created by the application of bipolar
electrosurgical RF energy (coagulation) to the vessels placed between the jaws of the
instrument.
The ERBE BiClamp™ Open and Laparoscopic Instruments are designed for use with an ERBE
VIO Electrosurgical Generator (ESU) System having an Optional Bipolar Mode/ BiClamp™
upgrade and the multi-function receptacle. Not recommended for use with other manufacturer's
generators.

510K SUMMARY - Revised August 6, 2004
The indications for use with Open Instruments include: general surgery, gynecologic, urological,
and thoracic procedures where fusion of vessels and tissue bundles is performed including such
procedures as bowel resections, hysterectomies (both vaginal and abdominal), Nissen
fundoplication, adhesiolysis (lysis of adhesions), oophorectomy, etc.
The indications for use with Laparoscopic Instruments include: ail laparoscopic procedures
(including gynecologic, general, urological, and thoracic surgery) where fusion of vessels or
tissue bundles is performed including such procedures as bowel resections, hysterectomies
(both vaginal and abdominal), laparoscopic cholecystectomies (gall bladder procedures), Nissen
fundoplication, adhesiolysis (lysis of adhesions), oophorectomy, etc.
CAUTION: Vessel fusion can be affected by patient factors such as age, elasticity of vessels,
thickness of vessel walls, etc.; therefore, the physician should review each vessel fusion for sea!
integrity. This device is not effective for use in tubal sterilization/tubal coagulation for sterilization
purposes.
Similarities and__Differences_of the Proposed Devices to the Predicate Devices
Comparison/Substantial Equivalence): '
Similarities
The ERBE BiClamp™ Open and Laparoscopic Instruments have similar physical and
dimensional characteristics as the predicate devices. They have the same basic
technological characteristics and the intended use is the same.
Differences
The ERBE BiClamp™ Open and Laparoscopic instruments are different in that all of the
product line components or parts are provided non-sterile and reusable; where as, the
electrodes of the predicate’s Open Instruments and Laparoscopic Instruments are sterile,
single use. The ERBE BiClamp Open and Laparoscopic Instruments do not have closure
mechanisms to hold the instrument closed (or clamped), where as, the predicate devices
have closure mechanisms.
All the instrument designs have been verified or validated in design control by ERBE
Elektromedizin GmbH.
Conclusion: .
The ERBE BiClamp™ Open and Laparoscopic Instruments have the same intended use,
principles of operation, and technological characteristics as the predicate devices that were
previously cleared for market in a 510(k).
The ERBE BiClamp™ Open and Laparoscopic Instruments differ only in that all the
instruments and their parts are reusable and they do not have a closure mechanism to hold
the instruments closed.
In conclusion, there are no issues with the ERBE BiClamp™ Open and Laparoscopic
Instruments that would raise additional safety or efficacy issues when compared to the
predicate devices.

Dear Ms. Stephens:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 - Ms. Julie Stephens :
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
