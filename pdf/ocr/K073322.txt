510(k) SUMMARY — Fox Q-810, Q-980 and Q-1064 Laser

Applicant Name: A.R.C. Laser GmbH
Bessemerstr. 14, D-90411 Nurnberg, Germany

Contact Person: Reinhardt Thyzel, President

Date Prepared: February 8, 2008

Device Trade Name: Fox Q-810, Q-980 and Q-1064 Lasers

Device Common Name: Diode Laser

Classification Name: Laser Surgical Instrument

Predicate Devices: Fox Q-810 (K062619), Ceralas 980 (KO72106) and
Laserscope 1064 (K990903)

Device Description: Fox Q-810, Q-980 and Q-1064 are standard diode
medical lasers with 810, 980nm and 1064nm
wavelength, respectively

Intended Use: Fox Q-810:

indicated for surgical applications requiring the ablation,
vaporization, excision, incision, hemostasis, or
coagulation of soft tissues in medical specialties
including dermatology, dentistry, gastroenterology ,
general surgery, neurosurgery, otolaryngology,
ophthalmology, and pulmonology .

Fox Q-980:

‘indicated for surgical applications requiring the ablation,
vaporization, excision, incision, hemostasis, or
coagulation of soft tissues in medical specialties
including dermatology, dentistry, gastroenterology,

general surgery, genitourinary, gynecology,
neurosurgery, otolaryngology, orthopedics,

ophthalmology, pulmonology, and thoracic surgery.
Fox Q-1064:

indicated for surgical applications requiring the ablation,
vaporization, excision, incision, hemostasis, or
coagulation of soft tissues in medical specialties
including dermatology, dentistry, general surgery,
genitourinary, neurosurgery, otolaryngology,
orthopedics, ophthalmology, pulmonology, and thoracic
surgery.

Device Technological The Fox Q-980 uses diodes to generate energy in the

Characteristics and 980 nm range. (Commercially available) Fibers deliver

Comparison to Predicate energy to the tissue. The Fox Q-1064 Laser is the same

Device(s): system, but generates energy in the 1064 nm range.
The new Fox Q-810 is also the same, producing energy
in the 810 nm range.

Predicates: The Fox Q-810 Laser (cleared under
K062619) is the same system, but generates energy in
the 810 nm range (at a lower output than the new 810
nm device). The Ceralas 980 is also a diode laser
producing energy in the 980 nm range, and the
Laserscope system produces energy in the 1064 nm
range.

Performance Standards: The Fox Q-810, Q-980 and Q-1064 Lasers comply with
the performance requirements of 21CFR 1040.10 and
1040.11, with permissible deviations defined in Laser
Notice 50, dated July 26, 2001. The diode lasers also
comply with IEC 60601-1:1998 including amendment 1,
IEC 60601-2-22:1995, and IEC 60825-1:1993 including
amendments 1 and 2.

Conclusion: The Fox 810, 980 and 1064 Lasers are substantially
equivalent to the predicate devices. They have similar
intended uses and comply with the same safety and
performance standards.

Dear Ms. Paulson:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 - Ms. Kirsten H. Paulson
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0120. Also, please note the regulation entitled, “Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
