Device Description-Pump Generator i
The Aquamantys Pump Generator is a shelf top unit consisting of a sheet metal housing, front control
panel and side mounted peristaltic pump. Within the housing resides a main circuit board, a display
circuit board, a power supply board. a power transformer and the pump motor. The proprietary software
integrates the flow to the desired power setting and flow level selected. The pump generator can be set
from 20 to 200 watts and has high, medium and low flow rate settings.
The Aquamantys system includes the pump generator, cart and specified Aquamantys disposable devices.
The Aquamantys BPS 6.0 and the Aquamantys BPS 2.3 are hand held "wand" tike devices that consist of
a plastic handle with two metal tipped probes protruding from one end that interface with the operative
site. These devices have an electrical connector that plugs into the pump generator and have a section of
pump tubing that clamps into the peristaltic pump.
Compared to most conventional electrosurgical devices and generators. TissueLink bipolar technology is
based on simultancous saline irrigation and RF power delivery. as well as the treatment of tissue that is
not typically treated by surgeons ~ large areas of cut tissue that are oozing blood at a slow but steady rate
