510(k) SUMMARY OF SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS
{as required by 21 CFR, section 807.92( c )}
FOR
MODELS 28-2000 & 28-2600, AURA, 70 WATT SERIES
BIPOLAR ELECTROSURGICAL COAGULATORS

Common name: Electrical Surgical unit (ESU) / Electrosurgical Generator.
Classification name: Electrosurgical Cutting and Coagulation Device and
Accessories (§878.4400)
Product code: GE
The mode! 28-2000, Aura, 70 Watt Bipolar Electrosurgical Coagulator and the
model 28-2600, Aurapius, 70 Watt Irrigating Bipolar Electrosurgical Coagulator
are general purpose solid state bipolar generators used to supply the RF signal to
electrosurgical hand-pieces used on soft body tissues where a wide range of
tissue types, patient conditions, and load impedances are encountered. Where
applicable (i.e., Aurap/us) a peristaltic irrigation pump controls flow rate individually
or simultaneously while coagulating.
Technological safety and effectiveness is established by the fact that the Aura 70,
like its predicates, offers well-proven, basic electrosurgical unit technology. Its
footswitch activation and solid state circuitry delivers low voltage RF/bipolar
energy, interfacing with electrosurgical accessories via its standard 4mm female
banana jacks. The Aura 70 differs technologically from its predicates with only
minor operational features designed to enhance user interface. The following are
some of those features.

« While operating on both 115 and 230 VAC mains supply as ils predicates,
the Aura 70 does not require the placement of an external jumper in order
to select between the two different voltage levels.

* Activation of the Aura 70 is via footswitch only, eliminating the optional
hand switch activation of its 28-1000 predicate, which is viewed as a littleused option and expendable in order to simplify construction, and limit
size.

« While similarly relying on solid-state electronics, the Aura 70 has been
greatly simplified over some of its predicates by the use of microprocessor
technology and modular medical-grade power supply.

« The Aura 70 uses membrane keypads instead of potentiometers (knobs)
as adjustable controls for tonal volume and power level settings.

Performance safety has been tested in accordance with, and found to comply with,
the requirements of the applicable sections of the following standards and
guidelines;

* ANSI/AAMI/IEC 60601-1-2 (2001), Medical Electrical Equipment Part 1;
General Requirements for the Safety.

* {EC 60601-2-2 (1998), Medical Electrical Equipment Part 2; particular
Requirements for the safety of High Frequency Surgical Equipment.

* ANSI/AAMI HF 18 (2001), American National Standard for Electrosurgical
Devices

«= ANSI/AAMI/ISO 14971:2000, Medical devices — Application of risk
management to medical devices.

* General Principles of Software Validation; Final Guidance for Industry and
FDA Staff (issued January 11, 2002).

* Guidance for FDA Reviewers and Industry. Guidance for the Content of
Premarket Submissions for Software Contained in Medical Devices
(issued May 29, 1998).

Safety and hazard analysis has determined that the hazard conditions for the
Aura 70 range in the low-to-moderate level and for this reason are
acceptable.

Therefore, the Aura 70 is substantially equivalent in intended use, technological
safety and effectiveness, and performance to the following predicates;

« 28-1000, Kirwan 50 Watt Bipolar Generator,

* 26-2500, Aura, 20 Watt Bipolar Electrosurgical Coagulator,

« RF111, Pegasys Electrosurgical Generator, and

* 80-1170, Malis™ Bipolar Electrosurgical System CMC-IIL.

Received: August 16, 2005
Dear Mr. Prario:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosurc) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food. Drug.
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. ‘The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class I] (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CER Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
