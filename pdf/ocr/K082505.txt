Device
Description: ’ The KLS Martin Electrosurgical Instruments
are surgical instruments that allow the surgeon
to cauterize and coagulate tissue by passing a
electrical current that is provided by a
electrosurgical generator. The instruments are
insulated to isolate the user from the current.
The KLS Martin Electrosurgical Instruments
are manufactured in a variety of shapes and
sizes to allow the operating surgeon choices
for optimum efficiency.
Technological Characteristics:
Similarities to Predicate:
: The KLS Martin Electrosurgical Instruments
are identical in design, manufacturing, material
. . and-operation to the Claris Non-Stick Bipolar

(K981919) and Bissinger Detachable Bipolar
Coagulation Forceps (K970968).
Substantial Equivalence: Due to identical operating aspecis, the design,
the ability to be utilized with multiple generators
and the same manufacturing facility as the /
Claris Non-Stick Bipolar Forceps (K051429),
BiTech Bipolar Scissors (K042077),
POWERGRIP Bipolar Coagulation Forceps
(K033177), Bissinger Cables (K98191 9) and
Bissinger Detachable Bipolar Coagulation
. Forceps (K970968) and have the same
indications for use leads to the decision that
the KLS Martin Electrosurgical Instruments are
substantially equivalent to the predicate
devices.
