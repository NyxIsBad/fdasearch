Device Description
The Optical Integrity General Shaped (GS) Fiber is a fiber optic laser delivery system consisting
of a3 meter long silica fiber, clad in fluorinated doped silica, buffered with a fluorinated acrylate
and a shaped tip. As an integral part of a laser system, the GS fiber may be used for a wide
variety of surgical procedures.
Indications for Use
The Optical Integrity General Shaped Fiber is intended to be used for vaporization, cutting,
ablation and coagulation of soft tissue in conjunction with or without endoscopic equipment
including laparoscopes, hysteroscopes, arthroscopes, bronchoscopes, cystoscopes, ureteroscopes,
gastroscopes, and colonoscopes, or for contact or non-contact surgery with or without handpieces
for use in coagulation, incision/excision, ablation and vaporization of soft tissue.
The Optical Integrity GS Fiber is indicated for use in medicine and surgery in the following
specialties: Urology, Plastic Surgery, Radiology, Dermatology, Pulmonology, Gastroenterology,
Gynecology, ENT, General and Vascular Surgery, Lithotripsy, Arthroscopy, Podiatry,
Orthopedics and Neurosurgery.
Technological Characteristics and Performance Data
Design changes made to the Optical Integrity GS Fiber are the addition of an internal proprietary
quartz sleeve reflector which protects the laser focusing lens from back splatter of vaporized
metal from the connector ferrule and the addition of an optical secondary memory cladding to
help guide a steerable endoscope with the optical fiber.
Bench testing was performed to demonstrate that the device will perform as intended.
