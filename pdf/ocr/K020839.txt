Vv. Indications for Use
The Lumenis Family of Intense Pulsed-Light (IPL) and IPL/Nd:YAG laser systems (and
the delivery accessories that are used with them to deliver light and/or laser energy) are
indicated for use in surgical, aesthetic and cosmetic applications requiring selective
photothermolysis (photocoagulation or coagulation) and hemostasis of soft tissue in the
medical specialties of general and plastic surgery, and dermatology. The Lumenis Family
of Intense Pulsed-Light (IPL) and IPL/Nd:YAG laser systems is indicated for the
treatment of tattoos and benign pigmented epidermal and cutaneous lesions, including
warts, scars and striae, and the treatment of benign cutaneous vascular lesions, including
port wine stains, hemangiomas, facial, truncal and leg telangiectasias, rosacea, angiomas
and spider angiomas, poikiloderma of Civatte, leg veins and venous malformations, and
the removal of unwanted hair from all skin types, and to effect stable long-term, or
permanent’, hair reduction in skin types I-V through selective targeting of melanin in hair
follicles (515 — 1200 nm), and for the coagulation and hemostasis of vascular lesions and
soft tissue (1064 nm).
In addition, the Lumenis Family of IPL/Nd:YAG laser systems (1064 nm) is safe and
effective when indicated for coagulation and hemostasis of vascular lesions and soft tissue,
including, the treatment and clearance of superficial and deep  telangiectasias
(venulectasias) and reticular veins (0.1-4.0 mm diameter) of the leg.
The Real Time Chiller is indicated for use in cooling the epidermis at the treatment site
prior to, during and after light or laser treatment in general surgery, plastic surgery and
dermatology to reduce pain during and/or associated with light or laser treatment (via
partial anesthesia from cooling), to reduce discomfort during and/or associated with light
or laser treatment, to minimize thermal injury, including thermal necrosis, to non-target
skin and skin structures during and/or associated with light or laser treatment, thus
reducing possible complications such as  scabbing, scarring, hyper- and/or
hypopigmentation, to allow the use of higher light or laser fluences for light or laser
treatments (such as for hair removal and the treatment of vascular or pigmented lesions),
to reduce potential side effects of light or laser treatments (such as for hair removal and
the treatment of vascular or pigmented lesions), and to protect the skin from thermal
necrosis, thus reducing possible complications such as scabbing, scarring, hyper- and/or
hypopigmentation.

VI. Rationale for Substantial Equivalence
The Lumenis Family of Intense Pulsed-Light (IPL) and IPL/Nd:YAG laser systems share
the same general indications for use, and therefore is substantially equivalent for use in
surgical, aesthetic and cosmetic applications to the ESC Medical Systems EpiLight intense
pulsed light systems (K991935, K994014), the ESC Medical Systems MultiLight intense
pulsed light systems (K994014), the ESC Medical Systems Photoderm HR intense pulsed
light systems (K991935), the ESC Medical Systems Photoderm Nd:YAG Accessory
(K980537), the ESC Medical Systems Photoderm PL intense pulsed light systems
(K960772), the ESC Medical Systems Photoderm VL intense pulsed light system
(K950493), the Candela SPTL-le Pulsed Dye laser system (K011092), the Candela
Dynamic Cooling Devices (KO01589 & K951033), the MedArt 520 Cooling System
(K000503), the OptoMed DermaCool System and Handpieces (K990417), and the
Coherent Epidermal Chiller Tip (K960032). In addition, clinical data demonstrated that

ko20p37 70

the Lumenis Family of IPL/Nd:YAG laser systems (1064 nm) are safe and effective when
indicated for use in specific applications in the medical specialties of general and plastic
surgery, and dermatology.

VII. Safety and Effectiveness Information
Clinical data was provided to demonstrate that the Lumenis Family of IPL/Nd:YAG laser
systems (1064 nm) are safe and effective, when indicated in specific applications in the
medical specialties of general and plastic surgery, and dermatology. Performance data
was provided to demonstrate that the Cooling Head integrated into the Treatment Head of
the delivery handpiece for the Lumenis Family of Intense Pulsed-Light (IPL) and
IPL/Nd: YAG laser systems operates in accordance with its specifications.

VIII. Conclusion
The Lumenis Family of Intense Pulsed-Light (IPL) and IPL/Nd:YAG laser systems were
found to be substantially equivalent to the predicate ESC Medical Systems EpiLight
intense pulsed light systems (K991935, K994014), the ESC Medical Systems MultiLight
intense pulsed light systems (K994014), the ESC Medical Systems Photoderm HR intense
pulsed light systems (K991935), the ESC Medical Systems Photoderm Nd:YAG
Accessory (K980537), the ESC Medical Systems Photoderm PL intense pulsed light
systems (K960772), the ESC Medical Systems Photoderm VL intense pulsed light system
(K950493), the Candela SPTL-le Pulsed Dye laser system (KO11092), the Candela
Dynamic Cooling Devices (K001589 & K951033), the MedArt 520 Cooling System
(K000503), the OptoMed DermaCool System and Handpieces (K990417), and the
Coherent Epidermal Chiller Tip (K960032). The Lumenis Family of Intense Pulsed-Light
(IPL) and IPL/Nd:YAG laser systems shares similar indications for use, design features,
and similar functional features as, and thus are substantially equivalent to, the currently
marketed predicate devices.
Clinical data was provided to demonstrate that the Lumenis Family of IPL/Nd:YAG laser
systems (1064 nm) are safe and effective, when indicated in specific applications in the
medical specialties of general and plastic surgery, and dermatology.
