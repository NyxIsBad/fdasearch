ConMed Optimizer Snare cleared under K820430 on April 8, 1982
Olympus SD Electrosurgical Snare cleared under K902735 on August 2,

ERBE Argon Plasma Coagulator cleared in KO13348 on October 26, 2001
4. Device Description:
The Beamer Argon Snare Probe is used in conjunction with the Beamer
system generator for the delivery of gas and electrosurgical current
through a flexible endoscope to an electrode wire snare at the operative
site.
The Beamer Snare Probe consists of connectors for attachment to the
output of an Argon Beam Coagulation Unit. The device also consists of
catheter tubing for delivering argon gas to the operative site within the
patient, as well as an internal wire to carry high frequency (HF)
electrosurgical current to the electrosurgical snare. The snare probe
device is provided in two lengths 160 cm and 230 cm for use in flexible
bronchoscopes, gastroscopes, colonoscopes and duodenoscopes.
The electrosurgical snare is provided in a symmetrical loop (braided or
monofilament oval) in sizes of 15mm and 30mm and can be positioned
back into the catheter tube, such that it does not contact the patient's
tissue during the argon beam coagulation procedure.
The Beamer Argon Snare Probe consists of a stainless steel wire that
extends from the probe connector to the distal end of the probe. The

proximal end of the stainless steel wire is locked into the connector b6édy.
The distal end of the wire is soldered to a snare shaped wire located at the
distal end of the probe. In its retracted position the snare wire is in electric
contact to a tungsten electrode. The distal end of the Beamer Probe has
a ceramic tip which provides a thermal insulation barrier for the tubing to
prevent heat degradation during coagulation. The tungsten electrode
remains recessed in the ceramic tip such that there is no tissue contact
during the argon beam coagulation procedure.
There are five configurations of the Beamer Argon Snare Probe. The
probes vary in length and loop configuration to accommodate the
procedure performed by the physician. The Beamer Argon Snare Probes
are provided sterile by ethylene oxide and are single use only.

5. Intended Use:
The Beamer Argon Snare Probe is used in conjunction with the Beamer
system generator for the delivery of gas and electrosurgical current
through a flexible endoscope to an electrode wire snare at the operative
site.

6. Comparison of Technological Characteristics:
The Beamer Snare Probes are substantially equivalent to the predicate
devices both in intended use, technological characteristics and materials.

7. Performance Testing:
Biocompatibility and bench testing have been performed to demonstrate
equivalence of the Beamer Argon Snare Probes to their predicate devices.
All testing passed the predetermined performance specifications.

Trade/Device Name: Beamer” Argon Snare Probe

Regulation Number: 21 CFR 878.4400

Regulation Name: Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation device and accessories

Regulatory Class: II

Product Code: GEI

Dated: June 03, 2008

Received: June 05, 2008
Dear Mr. Lehtonen:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class IIT (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 — Mr. Daniel W. Lehtonen
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, “Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance
at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address
