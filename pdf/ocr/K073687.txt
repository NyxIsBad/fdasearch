Summary Prepared: August 20, 2007
Trade Name: Habib Laparoscopic Hexablate
Common Name: Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation device and accessories
Classification: Class It per 21 CFR 878.4400
Product Code: GEl
Predicate Devices: Habib Hexablate (KO71103) - EMcision

Habib 4X Laparoscopic (K062935) RITA Medical
Intended Use:
The Habib Hexablate is intended to be used to assist in coagulation of tissue during laparoscopic
intraoperative surgical procedures.
Description:
The Habib Laparoscopic Hexablate is a bipolar radiofrequency (RF) device that consists of a
handle, laparoscopic shaft and introducer and an array of seven parallel electrodes which extend
out from the laparoscopic shaft. The electrode configuration consists of six electrodes in a ring
and one electrode in the center of the ring. The Habib Laparoscopic Hexablate has an attached
cable which connects the device to the Habib Hexablate Switch Unit and then to an RF
Generator. The electrodes are inserted into tissue and the tissue is coagulated using RF power.
The Habib Laparoscopic Hexablate is designed for use in laparoscopic surgery and is a single
use device.

SECTION 3
Summary of Safety and Effectiveness
Technologica! Differences:
The Habib Laparoscopic Hexablate has the same basic technological characteristics as the Habib
Hexablate (K071103). Both devices use bipolar RF energy through a number of electrodes to
create a volume of coagulated tissue. The primary difference is that the Habib Laparoscopic
Hexablate is used via a laparoscopic port. The size and shape of the coagulation zone created by
each device is similar. Both devices uses aspiration through the center electrode to remove fluids
and gases from the center of the coagulation zone.
The Laparoscopic Hexablate is fitted with an introducer which allows the electrodes to pass
through a standard @12mm laparoscopic port without damaging the seals.
The Habib 4X Laparoscopic (K062935) has the same basic technological characteristics as the
Habib Laparoscopic Hexablate. Both devices use bipolar RF energy through a number of
electrodes to create a volume of coagulated tissue during laparoscopic procedures. The primary
difference is that the Habib 4X Laparoscopic and the Habib Laparoscopic Hexablate is the
number of electrodes. The Habib 4X Laparoscopic has 4 electrodes on a fixed 10mm diameter,
whilst the Habib Laparoscopic has 7 electrodes (six outer array and 1 centre) which deploy upon
exit of the introducer port to 20mm diameter.
Performance Data:
Performance testing was done to ensure that the Habib Laparoscope Hexablate functions as
intended and meets design specifications. Sufficient data was obtained to show that the device is
substantially equivalent to the predicate device, and meets safety and effectiveness criteria.

Received: December 28, 2007
Dear Mr. Christensen:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicabie, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
