2. Device Name
Trade name: EnSeal Vessel Sealing & Hemostasis System
Common name: Electrosurgical open and laparoscopic instruments and accessories
Classification name: Electrosurgical Cutting and Coagulation Device and Accessories
(per 21 CFR section 878.4400) and Gynecologic Electrocautery and Accessories (per 21
CFR 884.4120).
3. Predicate Device
ValleyLab LigaSure Vessel Sealing System (K981916).
4. Device Description
The EnSeal Laparoscopic devices are tubular instruments with grasping jaws at the distal
end, which are actuated by a handle at the proximal end of the device. The distal end
contains bipolar electrodes for sealing vessels, and a mechanical cutting blade for
transecting vessels. The EnSeal Open devices are reusable forceps-type devices with
one snap-in single use, disposable bipolar electrode, and one permanent, reusable
electrode in the jaws of the device. Connectors attached to an electrical cable connect
the device to the ECA (EnSeal Controller Adapter) accessory which connects the device
to a standard O.R. electrosurgical generator.
§. Intended Use
The SurgRx EnSeal devices are intended for use during open or laparoscopic general
and gynecologic surgery to cut and seal vessels, cut, grasp and dissect tissue and/or
seal vessels during surgery. The SurgRx EnSeal Vessel Sealing & Hemostasis System
has not been shown to be effective for tubal sterilization or tubal coagulation for
sterilization procedures. Do not use this system for these procedures,
6. Technological Characteristics
The EnSeal devices are similar to the predicate devices in that they are all bipolar
instruments used to cut and seal vessels, grasp and dissect tissue, utilizing RF powered
distal ends. They vary in technological characteristics by jaw design.
7. Performance Data
Preclinical laboratory (bench studies) and performance tests were executed to ensure the
devices functioned as intended and met design specifications.
8. Conclusions
The EnSeal devices outperformed the predicate devices in comparative preclinical testing.
Based on performance and functional similarities to the predicate devices, we believe the
EnSeal devices are safe and effective and substantially equivalent to the predicate
devices.

e Pacemakers and implanted cardioverter/defibrillators can be adversely affected by RF signals.
Consult the pacemaker/cardioverter/defibrilator manufacturer for further information when use
of electrosurgical equipment is planned in patients with these devices. If the patient has an
internal cardiac defibrillator (ICD), contact the ICD manufacturer instructions before performing
electrosurgery. This treatment may cause multiple activations of an ICD.

e SurgRx recommends against the use of laparoscopic surgery on pregnant patients.

« SurgRx recommends against the use of electrosurgery for circumcisions.

« The SurgRx EnSeal Vessel Sealing & Hemostasis System has not been shown to be effective
for tubal sterilization or tubal coagulation for sterilization procedures. Do not use this system
for these procedures.

Dear Mr. Christensen:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration. :
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class ITI (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
