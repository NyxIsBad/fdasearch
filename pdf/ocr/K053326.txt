c. Description of Device
The Estech Cobra Cardiac Electrosurgical Unit and Estech Cable comprise a system that
is identical to the Boston Scientitie Cobra Cardiac Electrosurgical System.
Both Systems are comprised of three components: the (radiofrequency) RF Probe,
Electrosurgical Unit (USSU) and Instrument (Cobra) Cable. The Cable ts an accessory to
the FSU.) The Estech RIE Probes have been the subject of previous premarket
notifications.
The ESU ts a software controlled high trequeney electronic instrument. provided with
controls for set temperature. power Limit, and number of active electrodes. Phe ESU
delivers 460 KHz of RF energy to selected Probe electrodes. The ESU measures

temperatures from the Probe thermocouples and modulates the RF energy to keep all
selected electrodes’ temperatures essentially the same; it adjusts the power output to
maintain the maximum temperature of all selected electrodes close to the set point. The
LSU has readouts for temperature, time of energy delivery, and delivered power. Front
panel connectors include connections for the Instrument Cable, and third party dispersive
or indifferent (DIP) electrodes.
The Instrument Cable (Cobra Cable) connects the ESU to the RF Probe. It is supplied
sterile to the user. The User can resterilize the Cable.
d. Intended Use
The Estech Cobra Cardiac Electrosurgical System is intended for the
coagulation of cardiac tissue using radiofrequency (RF) energy during
cardiac surgery. The System can be used during general surgery to
coagulate soft tissue. The System may also be used to coagulate blood
and soft tissue to produce hemostasis.
e. Comparison to Predicate Device
The Estech Cobra Cardiac Electrosurgical Unit is identical in intended use, technology.
design, materials, manufacture, and packaging to that of the Boston Scientific Cobra
Cardiac Electrosurgical System (K013873). The Instrument/Cobra Cables are
accessories to their respective ESU’s. They, too, are identical to each other.
Estech concludes that the Estech Cobra Cardiac Electrosurgical Unit is substantially
equivalent to the Boston Scientific ESU of the Cobra Cardiac Electrosurgical System.
f. Summary of Supporting Data
Supporting data is not necessary to support this submission since the Estech Cobra
Cardiac ESU is identical to the predicate device, the Boston Scientific ESU of the Cobra
Cardiac Electrosurgical System (K013873).

Dear Mr. Coombs:
This letter corrects our substantially equivalent letter of January 6, 2006.
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices,
good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class I] (Special Controls) or class I] (PMA),
it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be
found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Page 2 - Mr. Craig Coombs
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to continue marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your
device to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0120. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
