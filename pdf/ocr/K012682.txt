Date Prepared: August 10, 2001

Trade Name: SterilMed Reprocessed Laser Probes

- Classification Name: Laser, Ophthalmic

Classification Number: Class II, 21 CFR 886.4390

Product Code: HQF

Predicate Device(s): SterilMed’s reprocessed laser probes are substantially
equivalent to HGM Inc.’s Fleischman-Swartz Endo-Ocular
Probe (K840590), and to the counterpart devices from the
original manufacturers.

Device Description: Laser probes are an accessory used as part of a laser
delivery system. They consist of a probe handpiece, strain
relief, fiber optic cable, and connector. A laser light pipe
may or may not be part of the probe. The probes must be
connected to a laser console in order to deliver energy. The
laser probe delivers the energy to the treatment site through
an opening at the probe tip. Note, this submission is only in
regard to the laser probe itself. It does not pertain to any
other part of a laser delivery system such as the console.

Intended Use: Reprocessed laser probes are part of a laser delivery system
and are used in ophthalmic procedures where laser energy
is the mode of treatment.

Functional and

Safety Testing: Representative samples of reprocessed laser probes
underwent bench testing to demonstrate appropriate

functional characteristics. Process validation testing was
done to validate the cleaning and sterilization procedures as
well as the device packaging. In addition, the
manufacturing process includes visual and functional
testing of all products produced.
/ Conclusion: SterilMed’s reprocessed laser probes are substantially

equivalent to HGM Inc.’s Fleischman-Swartz Endo-Ocular
Probe (K840590), and to the counterpart devices from the
original manufacturers. This conclusion is based upon the
fact that these devices are essentially identical to the
predicate device in terms of functional design, indications
for use, and principles-of operation. —

Dear Mr. Fleischhacker:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and we have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the
indications for use stated in the enclosure) to devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to
May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have
been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
(Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices,
good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
