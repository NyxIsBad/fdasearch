Treatment of wrinkles and the treatment of inflammatory acne vulgaris. The Cheam laser may
be used with the Candela Dynamic Cooling Device, which provides a short burst of cryogen
spray prior to firing the laser pulse. The laser output energy is delivered via an optical fiber to a
handpiece, which produces circular beams with diameters of 5, 7 or 10 millimeters on the skin.
The cryogen, which is housed within the laser enclosure, is delivered via a hose to a nozzle
located in the handpiece.
The Candela Cbeam Pulse Dye Laser is equipped with safety interlock systems to protect
patients and operators. Users of the device make selections from an onboard control panel to
regulate operation during treatment.
