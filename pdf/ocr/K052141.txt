510(k) SUMMARY OF SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS

Device Name KK 0 5 2 { 41 .

Proprietary Name: Stryker Stiletto Electrosurgical Probe

Common and Usual Name: Electrocautery Probe, Electrosurgical Probe

Classification Name: Electrosurgical, Cutting & Coagulation Accessories
This 510(k) summary of safety and effectiveness is being submitted in accordance with the requirements
of the SMDA 1990.
The Stryker Stiletto Electrosurgical Probe is substantially equivalent in terms of safety and effectiveness
to currently marketed devices, including the Stryker Strykeflow Electrocautery Probes (K963765).
The Stryker Stiletto Electrosurgical Probe is a new product developed by Stryker. The Stryker Stiletto
Electrosurgical Probe is a suction/irrigation probe with electrosurgical capability, composed of stainless
steel, thermoplastic polymers (such as polyimide and PTFE) and thermoset polymers (like silicone
rubber).
The Stryker Stiletto Electrosurgical Probe is indicated for use in laparoscopic surgical procedures,
including laparoscopic general surgery, thoracic surgery, laparoscopic thoracic surgery, gynecological
surgery, general surgery and urological surgery. The device allows for suction and irrigation of sterile
irrigant solution. In addition, the device is intended to be used for electrosurgical cutting/coagulation
during laparoscopic procedures.
The Stryker Stiletto Electrosurgical Probe conforms to the following voluntary safety and performance
standards: IEC 60601-2-2 Particular Requirements for the Safety of High Frequency Surgical Equipment,
ANSI/AAMI HF-18 Electrosurgical Devices, ISO 10993 Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices, EN 552
Sterilization of Medical Devices — Validation and Routine Control of Irradiation.
There are no significant technological or performance differences between the Stryker Stiletto
Electrosurgical Probe and the identified predicate devices (Stryker StrykeFlow Electrocautery Probes,
K963765), nor are there any new questions raised regarding safety or effectiveness, therefore, the
Stryker Stiletto Electrosurgical Probe is substantially equivalent to the identified predicate devices and
surgery systems.

Dear Ms. Ong:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications

You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class [II (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may

or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
