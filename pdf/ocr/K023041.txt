VI. =‘ Technical Characteristics and Substantial Equivalence:
The W.O.M. Laser U100 has the same intended use, identical design features and
principles of operation as the predicate device W.O.M. Laser U100 (K011175).
Differently to the predicate device the W.O.M. Laser U100 described in this premarket
notification is not only indicated for use to fragment urinary stones but also biliary
stones. In addition, the W.O.M. Laser U100 has the same intended use and indication
for use, similar design features and similar principles of operation as the Candela MDL
2000 LaserTripter (K901723).
All three devices are intended for use in endoscopic surgical procedures to fragment
stones. Both the W.O.M. Laser U100 and the Candela MDL 2000 LaserTripter are
indicated for use to fragment urinary and biliary stones in the contact mode during
closed surgical procedures.
The W.O.M. Laser U100 and the predicate device W.O.M. Laser U100 (K011175) use
identical physical processes to generate the laser beams and method of transmission to
the stone. Although the W.O.M. Laser U100 and the Candela MDL 2000 LaserTripter
(K901723) generate their respective laser beams through different physical processes,
the characteristics of the treatment beams (wavelength, pulse energy, pulse duration
and pulse frequency) are similar. Moreover, the method of transmission to the stone
(laser fiber) is similar and both devices provide aiming beams to allow visual
indication of the stone location.
All three devices incorporate an internal water cooling cycle with a water-air heat
exchanger system. In addition, all three devices provide identical or similar safety
features and identical or similar parameters are displayed on the operator panel of the
devices.
Finally, the W.O.M. Laser U100 and the predicate devices transmit pulses of laser
energy by a quartz fiber to the stone (contact mode). The laser pulses are transformed
into an ultrasonic wave (acoustic impact waves) which mechanically crush the stone.
The differences of the W.O.M. Laser UL00 to the predicate device W.O.M. Laser U1L00
(K011175) are minor and raise no new questions of safety and effectiveness. Most of
the modifications rather have been made to fulfill the UL Standard 2601.

510(K) SUMMARY
Page -2- / -3VII. Safety and Effectiveness Information:
In vitro, in vivo and clinical data has been provided to demonstrate that the W.O.M.
Laser U100 is safe and effective for the fragmentation of biliary stones in closed surgical
procedures.
The device complies with the International Standard IEC 60601-1 (Electrical Safety) and
IEC 60601-1-2 (Electromagnetic Compatibility). In addition, the device meets the
requirements of the Underwriter Laboratories Standard UL 2601-1 and bears the CE
mark in accordance with the Medical Device Directive 93/42/EEC.
VIII. Conclusion:
The W.O.M. Laser U100 has the same intended use, identical design features and
principles of operation as the predicate device W.O.M. Laser U100 (K011175).
Moreover, the W.O.M. Laser U100 has the same intended use and indication for use, .
similar design features and similar principles of operation as the Candela MDL 2000
LaserTripter (K901723). The differences of the W.O.M. Laser U100 to the predicate
device W.O.M. Laser U100 (K011175) are minor and raise no new questions of safety
and effectiveness. Finally, in vitro, in vivo and clinical study results demonstrate that
the W.O.M. Laser U100 is safe and effective for the fragmentation of biliary stones in
closed surgical procedures.
Accordingly, W.O.M. WORLD OF MEDICINE AG believes that the W.O.M. Laser
U100 is substantially equivalent to the W.O.M. Laser U100 (K011175) and the
Candela MDL 200 LaserTripter (K901723).

Dear Ms. Raab:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
