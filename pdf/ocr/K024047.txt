Common Name: Argon Plasma Coagulator (APC) System
Trade/Proprietary Name: ERBE VIO APC (Model APC 2) with Accessories
Note: VIO stands for Variable Cut and Coagulation.
Classification Name: Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation device and

. accessories (21CFR878.4400)
Product Code: 79GEI
Legally Marketed ERBE Argon Plasma Coagulator (Model APC 300)
Predicate Device: and Accessories 510(k) Number: K963189
Device Description:
The ERBE Model APC 2 with Accessories is an argon plasma coagulation system and
is used in conjunction with an ERBE VIO Electrosurgical Unit (ESU). The ESU provides
high frequency (hf) voltage to electrically charge argon gas from the APC unit to form
plasma in the gas stream when in close proximity to tissue. Current density upon arrival
at the tissue surface from an APC instrument (applicator or probe) causes coagulation.
The APC with the ESU has a color monitor display that provides the user with an onscreen tutorial as well as setting and operational information. The VIO APC/ESU
system has various argon as well as argon assisted coagulation and cut modes. These
modes have defined effect levels to provide the physician flexibility in interventional
applications. Software in the ESU controls the microprocessor chip in the APC unit and
APC Handles. The VIO ESU/APC system is programmable and has error monitoring
features. There is an ERBE Communications Bus (ECB) Cable for the ESU to
tl-1

510K SUMMARY
communicate with the APC unit. A Pressure Reducer with Sensor is provided to
regulate the argon gas going into the APC unit. Two types of APC Handles are
available to activate the system. One of the Handles has a “ReMode’” feature so that
the physician can change between two pre-programmed modes via the Handle instead
of having to touch the display screen. Specific technical information on the APC and
Accessories can be found in Section IV. The APC unit and these accessories are
supplied non-sterile and are reusable. Cleaning/Disinfection and as applicable
sterilization instructions are provided in the respective User Manual or Notes on use.
See Device Labeling in Section V, Attachment 2, An APC Membrane Filter is also
apart of the system. A Filter is to be used for each case/interventional application. The
Filter is connected between the APC unit (at the argon gas port) and an APC Handle or
Connector Hose. The Filter creates a barrier to protect the APC unit from potential
contamination. Filters are supplied sterile by means of ethylene oxide and are
disposable (single use). They are contract manufactured and the sterilization cycle has
been validated. See specific technical information in Section IV and general use
information in the Notes on use in Section V, Attachment 1 for the Filter (Note: It is the
same Filter used on the predicate device.).
Intended Use:
The ERBE VIO APC with Accessories is intended to deliver argon gas for argon plasma
coagulation of tissue when used in conjunction with a compatible ERBE VIO
Electrosurgical Generator (ESU) and applicators or probes.
Similarities and Differences of the Modified Device to the Current Device (Predicate
Comparison/Substantial Equivalence): _
The ERBE VIO APC (Model APC 2) with Accessories has the same intended use,
principles of operation, and technological characteristics as the predicate APC in the
previously cleared 510(k). Also, materials, size, protective circuits, performance
characteristics, packaging, and labeling (except in the descriptions of the specific user
instructions) are the same or similar.
Changes involve having an on-screen tutorial and interface display through the ESU for
the APC. The modification also includes having the software of the ESU control the — APC unit. In comparison to the predicate, other changes involve the ESU providing all
the power to the APC through built in “HF Contacts” in the case of the units with
footswitch activation being directly through the ESU. Furthermore, the gas flow rate
range was made slightly lower with a one second shorter purge time. Modifications to
the APC unit also include slight variations to existing modes and more effect levels over
larger voltage ranges. All of the APC unit changes were done to have a user-friendlier
platform with a less complicated system but provide the physician more flexibility in
interventional applications. The specifics of the similarities and differences of the
modes can be found in the Comparison Table. Technical information on the modes can
be found in the APC 2 User Manual in Section V, Attachment 2. For the accessories a
Sensor was added to the Reducer and a “ReMode” button was added to a Handle. The
Sensor provides the VIO ESU/APC system with in-put gas pressure data. The

510K SUMMARY

“ReMode” button on the VIO APC Handle allows the physician to change between
modes without having to touch the monitor of the equipment during a procedure. The
performance standards/tests used/met were AAMW/ANSI HF 18, Electrosurgical
Devices; EN 60601-1/IEC 60601-1, Medical Electrical Equipment Part 1: General
Requirements for Safety; EN 60601-1-2/IEC 60601~-1-2, Medical Electrical Equipment
Part 1: General Requirements for Safety; 2. Electromagnetic Compatibility
Requirements and Tests; EN 60601-2-2/IEC 60601-2-2, Medical Electrical Equipment
Part 2: Particular Requirements for the Safety of High Frequency Surgical Equipment;
and EN 60529, Degrees of Protection Provided by Enclosures (IP Code).

. The software of VIO ESU controls the microprocessor chip in the APC 2 and APC
Handles. It was upgraded to perform all the features/functions of the any compatible
equipment. The Software is revision 1.1.2. General Principles of Software Validation;
Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, 01/11/02; Guidance for FDA Reviewers and
Industry, Guidance for the Content of Premarket Submissions for Software Contained in
Medical Devices, 05/29/98; and EN 60601-1-4/IEC 60601-1-4, Medical Electrical
Equipment Part 1: General Requirements for Safety, 4. Collateral Standard:
Programmable Electrical Medical Systems were followed. Per the FDA Software
Guidance Documents the software was determined to be a moderate level of concern.
Conclusion:

The 510(k) Guidance Document for General Surgical Electrosurgical Devices, 5/10/95
was followed for this submission. The Risk Analysis method used to assess the impact
of the modification on the device performance and its components followed EN 1441:
1998, Medical Devices Risk Management. All of the changes were verified or validated.
The changes did not raise safety or efficacy concerns nor adversely affect safety or
effectiveness. That is the modified device is as safe and effective as the predicate
device.

Dear Ms. Stephens:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class IIT (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
