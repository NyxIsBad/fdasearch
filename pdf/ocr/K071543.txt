Predicate Device(s)

K051168 HALO26 Coagulation System-BARRX Medical Inc.

K062225 HALO2© Coagulation Catheter-BARRX Medical Inc.
Intended Use / Indications for Use
The HALO*60+ Coagulation Catheter model is intended for use in the coagulation of
bleeding and non-bleeding sites in the gastrointestinal tract.
The HALO26+ Coagulation Catheter is indicated for use in the coagulation of
bleeding and non-bleeding sites in the gastrointestinal tract including but not
limited to, the esophagus. Indications include Esophageal Ulcers, Mallory-Weiss
tears, Arteriovenous Malformations, Angiomata, Barrett’s Esophagus, Dieulafoy
Lesions, and Angiodysplasia.
Technological Characteristics
The HALO™ Coagulation System consists of the HALO* Energy Generator with a
disposable single-use HALO*6+ Coagulation Catheter, a HALO™ Sizing Balloon,
an output cable, and an optional footswitch. The HALO*™ Coagulation System
comprising catheter model 32041-XX performance and mode of operation is
substantially equivalent to the already cleared HALO” Coagulation System
comprising catheter models 31041-XX and/or 31041-XXBR.
Substantial Equivalence
The HALO%6 Coagulation Catheter model 32041-XX and the predicate device
HALO™® Coagulation Catheter models 31041-XXBR and 31041-XX manufactured
by BARRX Medical Inc and Stellartech Research Co. respectively have the same
intended use, indications for use, technological characteristics, and principles of
operation. The technological differences between the HALO%9+ Coagulation
Catheter model 32041-XX and its predicates are:

1) Changes in materials for manufacturability

2) Changes in manufacturing processes
All these differences were evaluated on the bench and in the animal model and did
not raise questions regarding safety and efficacy. Thus the devices are equivalent.

Dear Ms. Filimon:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for
use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce
prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good
manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
. or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply
with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part
807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the
quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product
radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally

marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
