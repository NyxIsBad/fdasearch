510(K) Summary of Safety and Effectiveness
This 510(K) Summary of Safety and Effectiveness for the LC100 Diode Array Laser
System is submitted in accordance with the requirements of Safe Medical Device Act
(SMDA) of 1990 and follows the Office of Device Evaluation (ODE) guidance
concerning the organization and content of a 510(K) summary.

Telephone: 919-363-2432
Preparation Date: June 1, 2001
Device Trade Name: Palomar LC100
Common Name: Super Long Pulse Diode Laser
Classification Name: Laser surgical instrument for use in General and
Plastic Surgery and in Dermatology
(see: 21 CFR 878-4810).
Product Code: GEX
Panel: 79

System Description:
The LC100 delivers infrared laser light with a
wavelength of 810 nm, a selectable pulse duration
of 50-1000 ms. The corresponding fluence is
delivered through a 12x12 or 12x6 mm handpiece
15

tip. The laser pulses are generated at a maximum
pulse repetition frequency of 3.3 Hz.

The complete system consists of a, chiller, a
footswitch, and a handpiece containing diode bars
connected to the power unit with an umbilical. In
standard use, the handpiece is pressed against the
patient’s skin and a light pulse is delivered when the
footswitch is depressed. The handpiece tip is watercooled to provide active skin cooling. Laser
parameters and other system features are controlled
from the user interface panel on top of the laser
unit, which provides an interface to the system
computer.

Intended Use of the Device:

The LC100 Diode Laser System is indicated for
haire removal, permanent hair reduction, treatment
of pigmented and vascular lesions, including leg
veins, and incision/excision, ablation and
coagulation of soft tissue (for patients with skin
types I-VI, including tanned skin).

Performance Data: The differences in the specifications of the LC100
laser and the predicate device do not result in
different performance or raise new questions of
safety or efficacy.

Conclusion: Based on the foregoing, the LC100 Diode
Array Laser Systeim is substantially equivalent to
the legally-marketed claimed predicate device, i.e.,
the SLP1000™ and LightSheer™ diode lasers.

Dear Ms. Moore:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) notification of intent to market the device referenced
above and we have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use
stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce
prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act (Act). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls
provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual
registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against
misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III
(Premarket Approval), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations
affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 895.
A substantially equivalent determination assumes compliance with the Current Good
Manufacturing Practice requirements, as set forth in the Quality System Regulation (QS) for
Medical Devices: General regulation (21 CFR Part 820) and that, through periodic QS
inspections, the Food and Drug Administration (EDA) will verify such assumptions. Failure to
comply with the GMP regulation may result in regulatory action. In addition, FDA may publish
further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register. Please note: this
response to your premarket notification submission does not affect any obligation you might
have under sections 531 through 542 of the Act for devices under the Electronic Product
Radiation Control provisions, or other Federal laws or regulations.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your 510(k) premarket
notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed :
predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to
proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801 and
additionally 809.10 for in vitro diagnostic devices), please contact the Office of Compliance at
(301) 594-4659. Additionally, for questions on the promotion and advertising of your device,
please contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4639. Also, please note the regulation
entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR 807.97). Other general
information on your responsibilities under the Act may be obtained from the Division of Small
Manufacturers International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or

. number of re-growing hairs after a treatment regime.
The LC100 is also indicated for photocoagulation of dermatological vascular lesions,
including port wine stains, telangiectasia, angioma, hemangioma, spider nevi, and
other benign vascular lesions; photothermolysis of blood vessels (treatment of facial
and leg veins); removal of benign pigmented lesions, including lentigines, nevi,
chloasma, and café-au-lait; incision/excision, ablation and coagulation (homeostasis)
of soft tissue.
