2. Name of Device
Trade or Proprietary Name: LigaSure Advance™
Common Name: Monopolar and Bipolar Laparoscopic Electrosurgical Instrument
Classification Name:
¢ Electrosurgical Cutting and Coagulation Device and Accessories, and
* Gynecologic Electrocautery and Accessories
3. Predicate Devices
The Valleylab LigaSure Advance™ is substantially equivalent to the Valleylab
LigaSure™LS1500 (K031011 and K043273) and the Valleylab Laparoscopic Electrode
E2774-28 (K904560 and K964175).
The LigaSure Advance™ and the LigaSure™ LS1500 are used in laparoscopic surgery
to seal vessels by the application of RF energy to the vessels and tissues interposed
between the jaws of the instrument. Both incorporate a mechanical cutter to cut the
tissue after sealing.
in addition, the LigaSure Advance™ also includes a monopolar electrode extending
from one of the jaws of the device which can be used for monopolar dissection of tissue
planes similar to the Valleylab Laparoscopic electrode, E2774-28.
4. Device Description
The LigaSure Advance™ is a 5mm laparoscopic vessel sealer and divider with
integrated monopolar capability for energy-based dissection. The Valleylab LigaSure
Advance™ is for use only with the Valleylab ForceTriad™ energy platform
(electrosurgical generator), reference 510(k) notification KO51644. The device will be
offered in two lengths, 34 cm and 44 cm.

Kobs195 fog a I@
i>
The LigaSure Advance™ device will be used to seal vessels, including lymph vessels,
up to and including 7mm in diameter and tissue bundies. The sealed vessels and other
tissue structures may be divided by the deployment of a mechanical knife that will reside
within the shaft of the instrument and extends forward in a slot within the jaws when
actuated by a mechanism residing within the handle of the device.
The monopolar capabilities of the device will be used to electrically dissect through
tissue planes and to create openings in bowel (enterotomies) and stomach
(gastrotomies). This is accomplished through a small electrode that protrudes from the
distal end of one of the jaws of the device.
The controls for the device are all located on the handle. The instrument attaches to the
generator with “smart” connectors, that identify the instrument type to the LigaSure
generator, and a ten (10) foot cable. The instrument is supplied sterile for single-use.
5. Intended Use
The Valleylab LigaSure Advance™ is a 5mm laparoscopic, electrosurgical instrument
that incorporates both monopolar and LigaSure™ tissue fusion (bipolar) functionality. It
is intended for use with the Valleylab ForceTriad™ energy platform (electrosurgical
generator)in general and gynecological, laparoscopic, surgical procedures where
ligation and division of vessels, including lymph vessels, is desired. The monopolar
feature of the instrument will be used where electrical dissection through tissue planes
and creation of enterotomies or gastrotomies is desired.
The LigaSure function of the instrument creates a seal by the application of RF
electrosurgical energy to vascular structures interposed between the jaws of the
instrument. The sealed vessels and other tissue structures may be divided by the
deployment of a mechanical knife that will reside within the shaft of the instrument and
extends forward in a slot within the jaws.
Indications for use include general and gynecological, laparoscopic surgical procedures
{including urologic, vascular, thoracic and thoracoscopic) where electrosurgical ligation
and division of vessels, including lymph vessels, is performed. These procedures
include: laparoscopic gastric bypass, laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy,
Nissen fundoplication, laparoscopic colectomy, adhesiolysis, oophorectomy, etc.
The Valleylab LigaSure Advance™ can be used on vessels up to and including 7mm
diameter and tissue bundles as large as will fit in the jaws of the instrument.
The Valieylab LigaSure Advance™ has not been shown to be effective for tubal
sterilization or tubal coagulation for sterilization procedures, and should not be used for
these procedures.
6. Summary of Technological Characteristics
The LigaSure Advance™ has the same basic technological characteristics as the
predicate LigaSure device and the laparoscopic electrode noted above. The LigaSure

Advance™ will seal vessels (including lymph vessels) using bipolar RF energy and can
mechanically divide the sealed areas or tissue with a mechanical cutting device
incorporated into the shaft and jaws. In addition, the device also incorporates a
monopolar electrode on one jaw for electrosurgical division of tissue.

7. Performance Data

Performance testing and pre-clinical studies were performed to ensure that the LigaSure
Advance™ functions as intended, and meets design specifications. Sufficient data
were obtained to show that the device is substantially equivalent to the predicate
devices, and meets safety and effectiveness criteria.

Dear Mr. Copperberg:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class HI (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
