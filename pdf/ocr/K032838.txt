It complies with the same or equivalent standards and has the same intended

Device Description
The Celon ENT System is comprised of a power control unit (CelonLab ENT) and
bipolar coagulation electrodes. The CelonLab ENT power control unit delivers a
bipolar output via the bipolar coagulation electrodes of type CelonProBreath,
CelonProSleep, and CelonProSleep PLUS. A neutral electrode (return conductor)
is not required. The power control unit is user-friendly with a user display showing
all the necessary process parameters. After switching on the equipment, the user
selects the level of power and activates the radio frequency (RF) current by
depressing the foot switch. The power control unit delivers an acoustic signal as
an indicator of the coagulation status. Usually, general electrosurgical units have
a fixed activation tone. However, in the case of the CelonLab ENT power control
unit, the frequency of the acoustic signal is proportional to the tissue impedance.
This permits acoustic monitoring of the coagulation status by the operator, since
the latter is directly correlated with the impedance. If the impedance increases
above a certain limit, signifying that the coagulation process is complete, this is
additionally indicated by a clock pulsed sound and the power output is ceased
automatically. Overdose effects in the treated tissue area are excluded by this
power control function. The procedure time will be set automatically by the power
control unit. The time interval between activation of the power control unit and the
end of the coagulation procedure depends on applicator type, tissue properties
and power setting, and can vary between 3 seconds and several minutes.
Accessories included with the power control unit include a line power cable and
single pedal foot pedal (CelonFootSwitch).

Materials: Materials and construction of the Celon ENT System are compliant

with the international electrical safety standards IEC 60601-1, IEC 60601-1-2,

IEC 60601-2-2, and the American national standard ANSI/AAMI HF-18.

Additionally, the materials used in the design and construction of the

CelonProBreath, CelonProSleep, and CelonProSleep PLUS bipolar coagulation

electrodes, which have direct contact with the patient, are biocompatible

according to !SO 10993 or USP 23 Class VI.

Design: The system is designed to be a bipolar electrosurgical coagulation device

with an automatic power control, including automatic output power reduction and

acoustic monitoring of coagulation status.

Intended Use of the Device

This Celon ENT System has the same intended use as the legally marketed

devices. This application system, comprising the CelonLab ENT power control

unit and the CelonProBreath, CelonProSleep, and CelonProSleep PLUS bipolar
coagulation electrodes, is indicated for ablation and coagulation of soft tissue in
otorhinolaryngology (ENT) surgery including:

CelonProBreath: Submucosal tissue shrinkage for nasal airway
obstruction by reduction of hypertrophic nasal
turbinates

CelonProSleep: Submucosal tissue shrinkage and tissue coagulation
in the uvula/soft palate for the treatment of snoring

CelonProS/eep PLUS: Submucosal tissue shrinkage and tissue coagulation
in the uvula/soft palate for the treatment of snoring

The system is intended for use by qualified medical personnel trained in the use

of electrosurgical equipment.

Comparison with Legally Marketed Device:
It is the opinion of Celon AG medical instruments that the Celon ENT System is
of a type and substantially equivalent to legally marketed devices with respect to
intended use and technological characteristics. It will comply with the safety
requirements of IEC 60601-1, IEC 60601-1-2, IEC 60601-2-2, ANSI/AAMI HF-18
and applicable collateral and particular standards. Furthermore, the
CelonProBreath, CelonProSleep, and CelonProS/eep PLUS bipolar coagulation
electrodes, which have direct contact with the patient, are biocompatible
according to ISO 10993 or USP 23 Class VI. In addition, performance validation
testing has been done to validate the performance of the device. The comparison
results presented in this 510(k) notification show that the device is substantially
equivalent to legally marketed devices and is safe and effective in its intended
use.
Conclusions
The Celon ENT System does not result in any new potential safety risks and
performs as well as or better than devices legally on the market. Celon AG
medical instruments consider the Celon ENT System to be equivalent to other
marketed devices with the same indications for use and meeting similar
standards.

Dear Ms. Gwynn:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food. Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA),
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing p.actice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class {I (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA). it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition. FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
