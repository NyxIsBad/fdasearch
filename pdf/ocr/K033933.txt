510(K) SUMMARY
This summary of 510(k) safety and effectiveness information is being submitted in
accordance with the requirements of SMDA 1990 and 21 CFR §807.92.
The assigned 5!0(k) number is, KO33Q 3 3
1. Submitter's Identification:
Preswede AB
Flojelbergsgatan 8A
431 35 Molndal, Sweden
Date Summary Prepared: December 18, 2003
Contact: Mr. John Wilhelmsson, President
2. Name of the Device:
Powerlite 600@ EX System.
3. Predicate Device Information:
K# 030423, Powerlite600® EP System, Preswede AB, Sweden
K#030527, Vasculight, Model SR — Lumenis Family of Intense Pulsed-Light
(IPL) and IPL/Nd:YAG Laser Systems, Lumenis, Inc.
4, Device Description:
The Powerlite 600® EX System delivers pulsed light at a wavelength beginning
at a wavelength of 515nm. The device consists of three interconnected sections:
a light system console (including software and control electronics), a control and
display panel; and one or more attached hand-piece(s).
5. Intended Use:
An intense pulsed light, the Powerlite 6(00@ EX System is indicated for use in
surgical, aesthetic and cosmetic applications requiring selective photothermolysis
(photocoagulation) znd hemostasis of soft tissue in the medical specialties of
general and plastic surgery, and dermatology as follows:
e The treatment of tattoos;
* The treatment of benign pigmented epidermal lesions including dyschromia,
hyperpigmentation, melasma, ephelides (freckles);

e The treatment of cutaneous lesions including warts, scars and striae;

« The treatment of benign cutaneous vascular lesions, including port wine stains,
hemangiomas, facial, truncal and leg telangiectasias, rosacea, erythema or
rosacea, angiomas and spider angiomas, poikiloderma of Civatte, leg veins and
venous malformations;

e The removal of unwanted hair from all skin types, and to effect stable long-term,
or permanent, hair reduction in skin types I-V.

6. Comparison to Predicate Devices:
The Powerlite 6(00® EX System and the Vasculight/Powerlite 600@ EP devices
are very similar or identical in terms of the device structure and its technology.
Both systems are electro-optical medical devices designed for effective
photothermal treatment.

7. Discussion of Non-Clinical Tests Performed for Determination of
Substantial Equivalence are as follows:
Electrical and EMC testing per IEC 60601-1 and IEC 60601-1-2 requirements

8. Discussion of Clinical Tests Performed:
Non-Applicable

9. Conclusions:
The Powerlite 6(00® EX System has the same intended use and similar
characteristics as the Lumenis family of Intense Pulsed Light (IPL), Vasculight,
Model SR and the Powerlite 600@ EP System. Moreover, documentation
supplied in this submission demonstrates that any differences in their
technological characteristics do not raise any new questions of safety or
effectiveness. Thus, the Powerlite 600®@ EX System is substantially equivalent to
the predicate devices.

Dear Ms. Goldstein-Falk:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device

You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (sce above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class It (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
