The Erbium component of the OpusDuo EC Dental Laser System with the
additional periodontal, endodontal and soft tissue indications is substantially
equivalent to a combination of the following erbium laser systems cleared by the
FDA:
- KaVo KEY Laser 1242 (KaVo America Corporation) cleared under

K983100
-  FuturLase 3000/3002 Erbium Laser System (Pharos Optics, Inc.)

cleared under K974641

Inc.) cleared under KO11041
- WaterLase Millennium Dental Laser System (BioLase Technology,

Inc.) cleared for additional endodontic indications under K012511
The CO2 component of the OpusDuo EC with the additional periodontal
indications is substantially equivalent to a combination of the Opus 20 and Opus
Spectrum/Opus Duo cleared under K002899 and K014100, respectively, the
Uni-CO2 450P CO2 Laser System (Medart Corp.), cleared under K991297 and
the Opus 10™ Diode Laser (OpusDent Ltd.) cleared under K000990.

Performance Standards:
The OpusDuo EC Dental Laser complies with:
U.S. Federal Performance Standards 21 CFR 1040.10 and 21 CFR 1040.11 for
class IV Laser Products.
In accordance with FDA’s guidance “Use of Standards in Substantial
Equivalence Determinations”, OpusDent is declaring that the OpusDuo EC
confirms to EN 60601-1 and EN 60601-1-2.
In addition, the device complies with the voluntary standards, EN-601-2-22, EN60825-1, CISPR 11: 1997, class B and IEC 61000-4-2/3/4/5: 1995, EMI —
ENS55011 :1991, IEC 801:1991 as described in Section 5.

The Er: YAG laser component is indicated for caries removal, cavity preparation,
enamel etching and the incision, excision, cutting, ablation, vaporization, and
coagulation of soft tissue in oral and maxillofacial surgery and dentistry.
The CO2 laser component is indicated for periodontal procedures such as

oral soft tissue in procedures such as gingivectomy; frenum release; removal of
soft tissue, cysts and tumors.
Device Description:
The OpusDuo EC is a model of the Opus 20 Dental Laser System, which is
intended to aid during dental procedures performed either in hard or soft oral
tissue. This is a dual laser system incorporating an Er: YAG laser and a CO2
laser. The system is operating at a wavelength of 2.94 microns and 10.6 microns
respectively. The Er:YAG laser delivers to the tissue pulses with energies up to 1
joule per pulse and power up to 12 Watts. The CO2 laser delivers to the tissue
power in continuous mode (CW) up to 10 Watts and pulses (SP) up to 6 Watts.
Substantial Equivalence:
There are no unique applications, indications, material or specifications
presented herein. Evidence of equivalence has been demonstrated through:

¢ The OpusDuo EC intended use and indications for use were previously cleared
by FDA for the predicate devices.

*The technical characteristics of both the Er:YAG and CO2 lasers of the
OpusDuo EC system are basically the same as those of the cleared Opus 20
(K002899) and its new model Opus Spectrum/Opus Duo (K014100).

The Er:YAG component of the OpusDuo EC has the same or very similar
technical characteristics as its predicates; the KaVo, the FutureLase , the Pulse
Master and the WaterLase, including theory of operation, laser medium and the
ability to deliver the same wavelength (or very close value, in the case of
WaterLase) at a similar average power and pulse rate.

The CO2 component of the OpusDuo EC has the same or very similar technical
characteristics including theory of operation, laser medium and the ability to
deliver the same wavelength at the same maximal power pulse rate and pulse
duration as its predicate device, the Uni-CO2 450P system.

* Laser output values of the OpusDuo EC are well within previous cleared values
of the predicate devices as described.

*The predicate devices and other previous cleared lasers with similar energy
output have a proven safety and effectiveness in the treatment of the claimed
indications.

¢ Validation testing has confirmed that the design of the additicnal accessories,
which are required for the new applications, satisfies their technical
specification.

Therefore, we believe that the OpusDuo EC Dental Laser System is substantially
equivalent to its predicate devices cited above without raising new safety and/or
effectiveness issues.
