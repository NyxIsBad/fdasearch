Dear Ms. Templeman:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device

prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic

therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good
manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may

807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the

radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
