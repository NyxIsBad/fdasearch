— CANDELA 510(k) Summary
General Information:
This 510(k) is to provide notification of substantial equivalence for the Candela Vbeam Pulse Dye
Laser System, which is substantially equivalent to previously marketed devices intended for the
photocoagulation of benign cutaneous lesions, such as warts, scars, striea and psoriasis; benign
cutaneous vascular lesion, such as facial and leg telangiectasia, rosacea, port wine stains,
hemangiomas, angioma, spider angioma, poikiloderma of Civatte and in gynecology and treatment
of periocular wrinkles.
Classification: Class I (21 CFR § 878.4810 Laser Surgical Instrument for use
in General and Plastic Surgery and in Dermatology)
Common Name: Dermatology Laser, Vbeam Pulse Dye Laser System
Predicate Devices: Candela Clearbeam Pulse Dye Laser System (K013043)
Candela SPTL-le Pulse Dye Laser (K011092)
Candela Long Pulsed Dye Laser (K993671)
Candela SPTL Long Pulse/Tunable Pulse Dye Laser (K943292,
K954934)
SLS Biophile Ltd. NLite Pulse Dye Laser (K000811)
Description: /
The Vbeam Pulse Dye laser is a 595 nm, flash lamp excited pulsed dye medical laser, controlled by
an embedded microprocessor. The Vbeam Pulse Dye Laser System is comprised of a power
supply, optical delivery system, software control system and Dynamic Cooling Device. The laser
output energy is delivered via an optical fiber to a handpiece, which produces circular or elliptical
laser beams onto the skin. The Dynamic Cooling Device provides a short burst of cryogen spray
during the laser treatment. The cryogen, which is housed within the laser enclosure, is delivered
via a hose to a nozzle located in the handpiece. The Dynamic Cooling Device functions to cool the
skin during the laser treatment minimizing thermal damage to skin during laser treatment and
reducing pain associated with laser treatment.
The Candela Vbeam Pulse Dye Laser is equipped with a safety interlock system to protect patients
and operators. Users of the device make selections from an onboard contro! panel to regulate
operation during treatment.
Testing:
As a laser product, the Vbeam Pulse Dye Laser is required to conform and will conform to the
Laser Performance Standards (21 CFR 1000 - 1040). In addition, the device will conform to the
UL 2601 Electrical Safety Standard and with the Harmonized Standard EN 60601-1-2, Part 2
established by and required by the European Community (EC).
The Candela Vbeam Pulse Dye Laser System has the same intended use, utilizes similar operating
principles and matches key design aspects, including spot sizes, pulse durations, wavelength and
the same maximum delivered energy as the predicate devices.
On the basis of similarities in methods of assembly, method of operation, and intended uses,
Candela believes that its Candela Vbeam Pulse Dye Laser is substantially equivalent to the
predicate devices.

Dear Mr. Nelson:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
