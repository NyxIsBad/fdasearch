Intended Use / Indications for Use k 6 f 222) ,

The Ceralas D1470 is a diode laser that is intended for delivery of laser light to soft tissue
: in non-contact mode during general surgery procedures. The device is indicated for the

treatment of reflux of the saphenous veins associated with varicose veins and varicosities

Technological Characteristics
The Ceralas D1470 has substantially similar technological characteristics as compared to
the previously cleared Ceralas D1470. The Ceralas D1470 contains an ELVeS Kit for
gaining access to the vasculature to treat varicose veins and varicosities associated with
superficial reflux of the saphenous veins.

Substantial Equivalence

The Ceralas D1470 is as safe and effective as the cleared Ceralas D1470 and the Cool
Touch CTEV laser. The Ceralas 1470 has the same intended uses and similar indications,
technological characteristics, and principles of operation as its predicate devices. The
minor technological differences between the Ceralas D1470 and its predicate device
raises no new issues of safety or effectiveness. Thus, the Ceralas D1470 is substantially
equivalent.
