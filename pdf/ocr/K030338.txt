Intended Use
The iClear Phototherapy System is intended to provide phototherapeutic
light to the body. The iClear is generally indicated to treat dermatological
conditions. The iClear is specifically indicated to treat moderate
inflammatory acne vulgaris.

Technological Characteristics
The iClear Therapy System is a high intensity lamp intended for the therapy
of dermatological disorders such as moderate inflammatory acne vulgaris by
emitting visible light in the violet-blue range with fluency of light ranging
between 50-200 mW/cm2. The system includes a spectral band light source
with spectral emittance concentrated in the violet/blue spectral band and an
optical system for controlling spectra and beam parameters of the light
source. It also includes a mechanical fixture for holding the light source at an
adjustable distance and direction related to the skin treatment area, and an
timer unit to indicate the duration of light treatment.

Substantial Equivalence
The iClear has the same intended use indications for use and similar
principles of operation, and technological characteristics as the CureLight
ClearLight. Thus, iClear is substantially equivalent to its predicate device.

Dear Mr. Kahan:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing

(21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). Other general
