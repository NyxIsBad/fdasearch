Common Name: Electrosurgical Generator (ESU) System
Trade/Proprietary Name: ERBE ViO ESU (Model VIO 300 D)
Classification Name: Electrosurgical cutting and coaguiation device and
accessories (21 CFR 878.4400)
Product Code: GEI
Legally Marketed ERBE VIO ESU (Model VIO 300 D) with Accessories
Predicate Device: 510(k) Number: K023886
Device Description:
The ERBE VIO ESU with Accessories is an electrosurgical system that uses high
frequency (HF) electrical current waveforms to cut and/or coagulate tissue. There were
no modifications to the Accessories from the previously cleared 510(k) K023886;
therefore, they are not included with this submission.
Unit (Model VIO 300 D) .
General Description. The ESU has a color monitor display that provides the user
with an on-screen tutorial as well as setting and operational information. The unit has
various cutting and coagulation modes with defined effect levels to provide the
physician flexibility in interventional applications (ie., its ability to generate HF
current). The system has automatic start and stop features. The equipment is
programmable and various accessories (e.g., footswitches, hand instruments, etc.)
as well as modes may be assigned to perform specific functions. When activated,
the device has an audio and visual error system (i.e., malfunctions or user errors are
detected with medical personnel being alerted visually and/or by sound with, in some
cases, no energy being delivered). Upon activation, the energy delivered (in watts)
from the ESU to the tissue is displayed on the display screen. Also, the unit can be
used in association with an ERBE compatible Argon Plasma Coagulator (APC). The
unit is supplied non-sterile and is reusable.
Note: ViO stands for Variable Cut and Coagulation. il

Indications for Use:
The ERBE VIO ESU with Accessories is intended to deliver high frequency (HF)
electrical current for the cutting and/or coagulation of tissue.
Similarities and Differences of the Modified Device to the Current Device (Predicate
Comparison/Substantial Equivalence):
ERBE VIO 300 D ESU
Similarities
The modified ESU (ERBE VIO 300 D ESU) has the same protective circuits and
intended use as the predicate ESU (ERBE VIO 300 D ESU) and most of the
performance specifications are the same. The modified ESU has the same protective
circuits as the predicate ESU, which displays the Equipment Output Error on the
monitor screen with a graphic representation so that you can readily determine the
cause of the error. The modified ESU will also be manufactured by ERBE
Elektromedizin GmbH in Germany and will be supplied as a non-sterile, reusable
ESU system. The packaging and labeling (User Manual, etc.) components are similar
except in the descriptions of specific user instructions.
Monopolar Modes:
The modified ESU has the same cut and coagulation modes, Effect levels, power
maximums (wattages) and voltage maximums. The User Manual remains the same
in the statement to the physician: “The power output setting should be set as low as
possible for the desired tissue affect. The purpose of this is to help reduce the
potential for capacitive coupling and inadvertent burning at higher wattages/
voltages.”
Bipolar Modes:
The modified ESU has the same cut and coagulation modes, Effect levels, power
maximums (wattages) and voltage maximums. The User Manual remains the same
in the statement to the physician: “The power output setting should be set as low as
possible for the desired tissue affect. The purpose of this is to help reduce the
potential for capacitive coupling and inadvertent burning at higher
wattages/voltages.”
BiClamp, APC, and Argon-Assisted Modes:
The modified ESU has the same cut and coagulation modes, Effect levels, power
maximums (wattages) and voltage maximums specific to BiClamp, APC, and
Argon-Assisted Modes. The User Manual remains the same in the statement to the
physician: “The power output setting should be set as low as possible for the
desired tissue affect. The purpose of this is to help reduce the potential for
capacitive coupling and inadvertent burning at higher wattages/ voltages.”

510K SUMMARY ie age 2 aA@
The ENDO CUT is a function in which the incision is automatically controlled in such
a way that alternating short cuts are combined with soft coagulation. Although both
of these modes were available on the original 510(k) ESU, the product was not
initially launched on the marketplace with this combination function available. The
predicate ESU has this feature specified as ENDO CUT | and ENDO CUT Q and
has been in use for approximately two years. The modified ESU will continue with
these same features except for slight differences as described below.
Differences
Monopolar Modes:
The ENDO CUT function was modified to more consistently emulate the original
ENDO CUT technology from the ERBE ICC Series (Models) of ESUs. The ENDO
CUT program, “I” (for use with needle instruments), has the same settings as the
predicate product. The ENDO CUT program, “Q” (for use with loop instruments),
has modified default settings from the predicate product. The control/ reguiation of
the ENDO CUT Q Mode was improved based on the field experience of the
predicate Mode. These modifications do not affect the safety or efficacy of the VIO
300 D ESU. The labeling reflects the changes.
Bipolar Modes:
The modified ESU has two additional modes than in the predicate ESU. Additional
modes were added per feedback from the physicians. A Bipolar Cut + mode and a
Bipolar Soft Coag + mode were added for greater flexibility of use with Bipolar
resection instruments. The addition of these modes does not affect the safety or
efficacy of the modified ESU. The labeling reflects the changes.
BiClamp, APC, and Argon-Assisted Modes:
A modification was completed on the internal hardware of the high frequency (HF)
generator printed circuit board (PCB). An additional decoupling capacitor was
added on the HF-generator board to reduce the neuromuscular stimulation (NMS)
effect during APC Pulsed Mode usage. Many of the gastrointestinal (Gl) operative
procedures are completed under minimal usage of anesthesia; therefore, the
additional capacitor will assist in reduction of NMS during the usage of the APC
Pulsed Mode. While NMS is a known issue with all high frequency electrical current
generators, the APC Pulsed Mode is ideal for some operative procedures and the
addition of the capacitor lowers the susceptibility of patients to NMS during use of
the mode.
All the unit modifications have been verified or validated in design control.

Conclusion: 4 4
The ERBE VIO ESU (Model VIO 300 D) has the same intended use, principles of
operation, and technological characteristics as the predicate ESU in the previously
cleared 510(k). The main modifications in the ESU reflect an ongoing commitment by
ERBE to satisfy customer feedback. [n conclusion, there are no issues with the ERBE
VIO ESU (Model VIO 300 D) that would raise additional safety or efficacy issues when
compared to the predicate device.

Dear Ms. Stephens:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
