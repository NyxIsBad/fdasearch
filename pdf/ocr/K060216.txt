5.9 Device Description
The Energist ULTRA VPL™ System is a light based medical device that delivers a beam of
pulsed non-ionising radiation in the region of 530nm to 950nm. The system is designed to be
compact and self contained and includes the following features:
« Control console unit
« Display panel
« Power supply
¢ Cooling system
« Removable handpiece with integrated switch, lamp, filter and glass coupling block
5.10 Intended Use
The Energist ULTRA™ VPL Intense Pulsed Light System is intended for permanent hair
teduction and the treatment of mild to moderate inflammatory Acne Vulgaris. It is also
indicated for photocoagulation of dermatological vascular lesions, photothermolysis of blood
vessels and the treatment of benign pigmented lesions.

ee
The 530 — 950nm intense pulsed wavelengths are indicated for:
The treatment of mild to moderate inflammatory Acne Vulgaris.
The treatment of benign pigmented epidermal and cutaneous lesions
including warts, scars and striae.
The treatment of benign cutaneous vascular lesions including port wine
stains, hemangiomas, facial, truncal and leg telangiectasias, rosacea,
melasma, angiomas and spider angiomas, poikiloderma of Civatte, leg veins,
facial veins and venous malformations.
« intense Pulsed Light Energy / wavelengths (610 — 950nm)
The 610 — 950nm intense pulsed wavelengths are indicated for:
The removal of unwanted hair from all skin types and to effect stable longterm or permanent’ hair reduction in skin types I — V through selective
targeting of melanin in hair follicles.
“' Permanent hair reduction is defined as a long-term stable reduction in the number of hairs
regrowing after a treatment regimen.
5.11 Comparison of Technological Characteristics
The Energist ULTRA VPL System has an identical intended use to the McCue predicate
system and identical technological characteristics except for modifications to the device
software and high voltage component. These differences do not result in differences in
performance or raise new questions of safety and efficacy. The Energist ULTRA VPL System
also has the same principles of operation, mode of action and equivalent energy outputs that
are used by the Cyden predicate device to achieve the treatment of Acne Vulgaris.
Performance data was provided to demonstrate that the system is capable of providing the
outputs necessary to achieve its required treatment parameters. The Energist ULTRA VPL™
System is therefore concluded to be substantially equivatent to both of the above named
predicate devices and minor differences to the systems do not raise additional concerns of
safety and efficacy.

Dear Mr. Smith:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class I] (Special Controls) or class Il (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must

comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing, (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as sot :
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050. .
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits yuut os vice
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
