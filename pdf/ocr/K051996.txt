2. Names
Device Name: Diomed Delta 15 Laser and
Diomed Delta 30 Laser
Classification Name: Laser Instrument, Surgical Powered
Product Code: GEX
Panel: Dermatology and Plastic Surgery
3. Predicate Devices
The Diomed Delta 15and Diomed Delta 30 Lasers are substantially equivalent to
the Diomed D15Plus and D30Plus Diode Lasers (K013499, K012398, K023543,
K041957).
4. Device Description
The purpose of this Special 510(k) is to notify FDA of the proposed new Diomed
Delta 15 and Diomed Delta 30 Lasers, which are equivalent replacements for the
Diomed | Splus and 30plus. Like their predecessors, the Diomed Delta 15 and
Diomed Delta 30 Lasers consist of a Class [V GaAlAs (Gallium Aluminium
Arsenide) diode laser with a wavelength of 810 + 20 nm and a visible light

€ DIOMED
(Special 510(k) Section 5. Page 7 of 9)
(aiming beam) 5 milliwatt Class Ifa diode laser with a wavelength of 635 — 655
nm.
The Diomed Delta 15 and Diomed Delta 30 Lasers are made up of a treatment
laser and aiming beam. The Diomed Delta 15 is a diode laser capable of
delivering up to 119 J/cm? of pulsed radiation via a fiber optic hand piece or 15 W
of continuous wave radiation via an optical fiber coupled to the laser aperture.
The Diomed Delta 30 is a diode laser capable of delivering up to 400 Jicm? of
pulsed radiation via a fiber optic hand piece or 30 W of continuous wave radiation
via an optical fiber coupled to the laser aperture. Drawings and photographs of the
Diomed Delta 15 and Diomed Delta 30 Lasers are included in the operator
manual found in Appendix K
5. Indications for Use
The Diomed Delta 15 and Diomed Delta 30 Lasers are intended for use in
delivering up to 15 or up to 30 Watts, respectively, of continuous wave or pulsed
radiation to a flexible optical fiber or spot handpiece for use in ablation, incision,
excision, coagulation and vaporisation of soft tissues in open and endoscopic
surgical procedures, including EndoVenous Laser Treatment (EVLT).
6. Performance Data
The Diomed Delta 15 and Diomed Delta 30 lasers have undergone a
comprehensive series of test protocols in order to qualify and validate the
performance of the devices. The results of the qualification/validation
demonstrates equivalent performance to the predicate devices which themselves
have substantial clinical and market evidence of acceptable performance. The
Diomed Delta 15 and Diomed Delta 30 are therefore validated for use on this
basis.

Dear Mr. Phipps:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class IH (Special Controls) or class III (PMA). it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal RegisterPlease be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2- Mr. Timothy G. Phipps
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
