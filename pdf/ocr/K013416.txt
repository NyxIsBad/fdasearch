New Device Name: EndoWrist™ Endoscopic Instruments
Classification Name: Electrosurgical Cutting and Coagulation Device
and Accessories
Common Name: Endoscopic Forceps/Graspers/Needle
Drivers/Scissors/Scalpels
Predicate da Vinci™ Endoscopic Instrument Control System
Devices (legally marketed under K965001/K990144/K002489/K01 1002)
Device The subject device(s) consist of a family of endoscopic instruments
Description with either grasping or cutting end effectors to be used with the
Intuitive Surgical® da Vinci™ Endoscopic Instrument Control
System. These instruments attach to the two instrument manipulator
arms on the Intuitive Surgical® Endoscopic Instrument Control
System. The instruments are re-usable (for a limited number of
uses), are provided non-sterile, and must be cleaned and sterilized

uses), are provided non-sterile, and must be cleaned and sterilized
Device before use (pre-vacuum autoclave). Single-use scalpel blades are
Description packaged sterile and provided separately. The instruments are
(continued) programmed for a limited number of uses to ensure reliability and
consistent performance, and have non-volatile “add-only” memory
that the Instrument Control System decrements after each use. .
The instruments attach to a re-usable, sterilizable adapter on the
. manipulator arm of the Endoscopic Instrument Control System to
provide a barrier between the (sterile) instrument and the (non-sterile)
manipulator arm. A mounting surface on the adapter provides a
means to secure a sterile drape that covers the arm assembly. This
allows instruments to be interchangeable during a procedure, without
compromising the sterile barrier. When attached to the manipulator,
the instrument is inserted through a cannula mounted to the
manipulator.
All instruments have articulations at the distal end that are controlled
by the surgeon. The instrument is the “wrist” of the system and
provides four (4) degrees of freedom (wrist pitch, wrist yaw, roll and
grip) and the manipulator arm provides an additional three (3)
degrees of freedom (insertion, arm pitch, arm yaw) for a total of
seven (7) degrees of freedom. The instruments described herein
share similar architecture, materials, and manufacturing processes.
The primary difference between the instruments is the tip end effector
also known as a “grip”.. The device and accessories are essentially
identical in size and shape to the referenced predicate device, and
represent standard embodiments of surgical tools modified for use
with the Intuitive Surgical® Endoscopic Instrument Control System.
Intended Use Intuitive Surgical® Endoscopic Instruments including scissors,
scalpels, forceps/pick-ups, needle drivers and electrocautery are
intended for endoscopic manipulation of tissue, including: grasping,
cutting, blunt and sharp dissection, approximation, ligation,
electrocautery and suturing.
Comparison to The Intuitive Surgical® EndoWrist™ Endoscopic Instruments
Predicate described herein are essentially identical in terms of shape, size,
Device function, activation, and intended use to the predicate Class II
endoscopic instrument cited.
Technological The technological characteristics of the subject devices are the same

Performance Design analysis and comparison as well as in vitro testing confirm

Data that basic functional characteristics are substantially equivalent to the
predicate device cited.

Conclusion Based upon the product technical information provided, intended use,
and performance information provided in this pre-market notification,
the Intuitive Surgical® EndoWrist™ Endoscopic Instruments
described herein have been shown to be substantially equivalent to
the current legally marketed predicate devices.

Dear Mr. Yramategui:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and we have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the
indications for use stated in the enclosure) to devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to
May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have
been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
(Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices,
good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class Iil (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 — Mr. Michael Yramategui
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801 and
additionally 21 CFR Part 809.10 for in vitro diagnostic devices), please contact the Office of
Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Additionally, for questions on the promotion and advertising of
your device, please contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4639. Also, please note the
