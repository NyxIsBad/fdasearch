Lotus II Pulsed Er: YAG Laser System
Legally Marketed Predicate Devices: + DermaStar Er:YAG Laser System (K014057) by
Asclepion-Meditec AG
« MCL 30 Dermablate Er:YAG Laser System
(K042968) by Cynosure, Inc.
Description of the Lotus II Pulsed The Lotus II laser system is an Erbium: YAG laser
Er: YAG Laser System: with a wavelength of 2.94 um. Laser activation is by
footswitch. Three basic elements of operations are as
follows:
1) AEr:YAG crystal is used as a gain medium
which produces a laser beam.
2) A resonator then amplifies the beam.
3) A lamp that contains Xe gas is used, as a
pumping light source. The lamp requires a
high-pressure power source device for
operation. When the electric energy.
generated from the high-pressure power
source is induced into the electrode of the
. lamp, it converts into light energy. This
converted light energy pumps the Er: YAG
crystal — a gain medium — and the light
exhausted from the crystal is amplified into a
. specific wavelength light. As it passes
between the resonant gases, laser beam
radiates to an output unit.
The regulation of laser output and repetition rate can
be set by the user via GUI (Graphic User Interface)
and controlled by microprocessor, which interfaces
with the power supply.
Intended Use of the Lotus II Pulsed The Lotus II Pulsed Er: YAG Laser System is a
Er: YAG Laser System: pulsed erbium doped yttrium-aluminum-garnet
(Er: YAG) laser. It outputs laser light with a
wavelength of 2940 nm, a wavelength very
efficiently absorbed by the skin. It is intended for
coagulation, vaporization, ablation and/or cutting of
soft tissue (skin) in dermatology, plastic surgery ;
(including aesthetic surgery), and ophthalmology
; (skin around the eyes). This includes skin
resurfacing and the treatment of wrinkles.

Lotus II Pulsed Er: YAG Laser System .

Performance Data: None .

Conclusion: The spec and intended uses of the Lotus II Pulsed
Er: YAG Laser System are the same or very similar to
those of claimed predicate devices. Because of this,
performance data were not required. The Lotus II
Pulsed Er:YAG Laser System is substantially
equivalent to legally marketed devices.
The Lotus II Pulsed Er: YAG Laser System is another
safe and effective device for coagulation,
vaporization, ablation or cutting of soft tissue (skin)
in dermatology, plastic surgery (including aesthetic
surgery, and ophthalmology (skin around the eyes).

Dear Mr. Cheon:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
, devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and ,
adulteration. :
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); medical device reporting (reporting of medical
device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
, forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic : :
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
