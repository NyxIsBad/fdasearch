Predicate Devices
Radiancy SkinStation Photoepilation Systems
AesThera Corporation, Model AIP
Medical Bio Care Sweden AB., ProLite
Palomar Medical Technologies, Inc., StarLux
Intended Use / Indications for Use
The SkinStation is intended to provide phototherapeutic light to the body and is
generally indicated to treat dermatological conditions. The SkinStation is specifically
indicated for removal of unwanted body and/or facial hair in adults with Fitzpatrick skin
types I-VI.
Technological Characteristics
The Skin Station that is the subject of this 510(k) notice is the exact same device
as the cleared Skin Station except for the addition of a light unit assembly specifically for
hair removal in Fitzpatrick Skin Types V and VI.
Substantial Equivalence
The Radiancy SkinStation, as modified, has the same intended use and very similar
indications for use, principles of operation and technological characteristics as the
cleared Radiancy SkinStation, and with the AesThera Corporation Model AIP, Medical
Bio Care Sweden AB. ProLite, and the Palomar Medical Technologies, Inc., StarLux.
The minor difference between the Radiancy SkinStation and the predicates do not raise
new issues of safety and effectiveness. Clinical data demonstrates that the Radiancy
SkinStation removes unwanted body and/or facial hair in adults with Fitzpatrick skin
types V-VI with only ‘minor side effects. Thus, the Radiancy SkinStation are substantially
equivalent.

Dear Mr. Kahan:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class IIT (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
