Proprietary name: Clinicon WaveGuide Platform with Interconnect for Luxar
Accessories
Common name: CO) Laser Powered Surgical Instrument
Classification: 878.4810
Product Code: GEX
Classification name: Laser surgical instrument for use in general and plastic surgery and
in dermatology.
Substantial equivalence claimed to:
K992472, Clinicon’s SureGuide CO2 Laser Beam Delivery System
K 960475, Modified Luxar LX-20
Description:
The Clinicon WaveGuide Platform (K992472, SureGuide CO2 Laser Beam Delivery
System now marketed as Clinicon WaveGuide Platform) is an accessory for COz laser
: systems. Its two primary components are a laser system interface adapter and a fiber
cable assembly consisting of a hollow silica fiber having an internal coating that reflects
and propagates CO) laser energy and a flexible protective outer cover.
The WaveGuide CO, Fiber Cable has FSMA 905 series fiber optic connectors on each
end and may be used with CO laser systems that provide such connectors between the
laser system and various beam delivery accessories.
The Clinicon Interconnect (Distal Adapter) is an accessory to the WaveGuide Platform
that duplicates the termination end & laser beam characteristics of the Standard Luxar
et

Fiber. This allows Luxar accessories to be attached to the WaveGuide Platform and used
in the same manner.
Intended use:
The intended use of the Clinicon WaveGuide Platform is to deliver carbon dioxide laser
energy from a CO, laser source to a COQ, laser accessory, with minimal beam
degradation. The waveguide platform can be used with various manufacturers’ CO)
lasers and laser accessories, including Clinicon accessories. The specific indications are
dependent upon the cleared indications for use of the laser system and laser accessories to
which the waveguide platform is attached.
The Clinicon Interconnect (Distal Adapter) enables Luxar accessories that are designed to
be used with the standard Luxar fiber cables to be connected with the Clinicon
WaveGuide Platform.
Summary of technological characteristics:
The Clinicon WaveGuide Platform is an accessory for CO laser systems. Its two
primary components are a turret adapter and a fiber cable assembly. A secondary
component is the Interconnect accessory.
The fiber cable assembly consist of a hollow silica fiber with an internal coating that
reflects and propagates the CO, laser energy and a flexible protective outer covering.
The fiber cable has a fiber optic connector on each end and may be used with CO laser
systems that provide such connectors between the laser system and various beam delivery
accessories. The fiber cable is available in various standard lengths between 0.5 m and
3.0 m, and functions over the wavelength range of 9 ~ 11 ym.
The Turret Adapter is the interface between the fiber cable and the CO, laser system, and
houses a focusing lens to align the beam from the CO, laser system into the waveguide.
The Interconnect duplicates the distal termination end and laser beam characteristics of
the Standard Luxar Cables. The Clinicon Interconnect contains a segment of the same
coherent waveguide used throughout the Clinicon Waveguide Platform. Uniquely in the
Interconnect, however, this waveguide segment is held in a manner that "scrambles" the
spatial coherence of the input laser beam, so that the output laser beam is spatially
incoherent. The particular distortion has been chosen so that the output of the Clinicon
Fiber Cable with the Clinicon Interconnect has the same beam divergence and multimode
character as does the output of the Luxar Fiber [cable]. This allows Luxar accessories to
be used with the Clinicon Fiber Cable plus Clinicon Interconnect.

Dear Mr. Curry:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complics with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must :
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 — Mr, Sean Curry ,
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) :
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801 and
additionally 21 CFR Part 809.10 for in vitro diagnostic devices), please contact the Office of
Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Additionally, for questions on the promotion and advertising of
