Trade Name: Aaron 950 High Frequency Electrosurgical Generator
Common Name: Electrosurgical Generator
Classification Name: Electrosurgical Cutting and Coagulation Devices and
Accessories (per 21CFR 878.4400)
The Aaron 950 High Frequency Electrosurgical Generator is a non-sterile, reusable
electrosurgical generator, which is designed to generate high frequencies (RF) of high
voltage and low amperage current.
The Aaron 950 High Frequency Electrosurgical Generator is intended to be used for
all electrosurgical cut, blend, coagulation, fulguration, and bipolar procedures.
The Aaron 950 High Frequency Electrosurgical Generator is substantially
equivalent to the Aaron Medical Aaron 1200 High Frequency Electrosurgical
Generator (K980366) in operation, intended use, materials, energy source, output,
method of preparation, and performance claims and is substantially equivalent to the
Aaron 900 High Frequency Electrosurgical Dessicator in terms of remote power
selection via handpiece. The Aaron 950 High Frequency Electrosurgical Generator
incorporates rotary dial or handpiece selected energy output, allowing independent
setting of cut and coagulation mode energy. Preset mode and output power button have
also been incorporated into the Aaron 950.
Testing performed on the Aaron 950 indicates that the device is substantially equivalent
in its performance and method of operation.
Hazard analysis evaluations are performed on the Aaron 950. There are no new hazards
presented with the use of the Aaron 950 as compared with the predicate devices.
In conclusion, the Aaron 950 High Frequency Electrosurgical Generator is substantially
