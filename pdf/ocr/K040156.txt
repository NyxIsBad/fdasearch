6. Rationale for Substantial Equivalence
The IFL Professional system and its predicate devices have the same
technological characteristics, i.e. pulsed light output in the 530-1200nm
wavelength range produced via electrical excitation of xenon flashlamps. The
Indications for Use of the IFL Professional and the predicate devices are
identical, namely long term stable, or permanent, hair reduction and the
treatment of benign pigmented and vascular lesions.
7. Safety and Efficacy Information
Not Applicable. Substantial equivalence to the predicate devices is claimed
due to identical technological characteristics and intended Indications for Use.
8. Conclusion
The IFL Professional system has been found to be substantially equivalent to
the predicate devices, specifically in technological design and operation and
similar in nature to the desired physiological interactions. The design and
manufacture of the device is in accordance with the relative international
standards and the potential risk to operator and patient has been minimized.

comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
