2. Device &
Classification Name: _ Laser Handpiece Accessory System (Class 2), Product Code GEX,
21 CFR 878.4810 — Tradename of device: Serenity PSF™ (Pneumatic Skin
Flattening) System

3. Predicate Device: Aesthera AIP™ Intense Pulsed Light System (K041554)

4. Description: The Serenity PSF™ (Pneumatic Skin Flattening) System is a device which has the
ability to produce a vacuum at a level of 200-700 mmHg. Suction can be delivered
through its handpiece, which has a sapphire window at its distal end, to be
positioned over the skin for iaser or IPL treatment. When the PFS system is
activated, the negative pressure results in the flattening of the skin of the treatment
site. During the time duration of suction, the treatment beam of the laser or IPL is
administered through the sapphire window of the handpiece, which is transparent
and thermally conductive. The resultant tight mechanical contact produced by the
PSF expels biood from the treatment site which enhances the light penetration of the
laser or IPL in tissue as well as the removal of its heat from the skin. This can
reduce the possibility of post treatment erythema.

5. Intended Use: The Serenity PSF™ (Pneumatic Skin Flattening) System is an accessory for a
compatible legally market Laser or Intense Pulse Light System for use in hair
removal. Its handpiece produces a negative pressure over the skin surface just prior
to the administration of the treatment beam through it.

6. Comparison of

Technological With respect to technology, the Serenity PSF™ (Pneumatic Skin Flattening) System

Characteristics: is substantially equivalent to one of its predicate device in that it produces a
pneumatic connection of the treatment site for the delivery of photonic treatment.
When the PSF™ System is used in combination with a legally marketed device such
as an IPL system, it also has the same basic intended use as this predicate device.

Dear Mr. Hattub:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
