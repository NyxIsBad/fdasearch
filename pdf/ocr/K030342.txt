Ik. Names
Device Names: Lumenis Family of Intense Pulsed-Light (IPL) and
IPL/Nd:YAG Laser Systems
Primary Classification ,
Name: Laser Powered Surgical Instrument (and Accessories)
Ill. — Product Description
Lumenis Family of Intense Pulsed-Light (IPL) and IPL/Nd:YAG laser systems are
comprised of the following main components:
* A light/laser system console (including software and control electronics);
* Acontrol and display panel;
* One or two attached hand-piece(s), which may have integrated skin cooling
components.
IV. _ Indications for Use
The Lumenis Family of Intense Pulsed-Light (IPL) and IPL/ Nd:YAG laser systems
(and the delivery accessories that are used with them to deliver light and/or laser
energy) are indicated for use in surgical, aesthetic and cosmetic applications
requiring selective photothermolysis (photocoagulation or coagulation) and
hemostasis of soft tissue in the medical specialties of general and plastic surgery,
and dermatology.
Intense Pulsed Light Energy / Wavelengths (515 - 1200 nm) are indicated for:
+ The treatment of tattoos and benign pigmented epidermal and cutaneous lesions
including warts, scars and striae;

* The treatment of benign cutaneous vascular lesions, including port wine stains,
hemangiomas, facial, truncal and leg telangiectasias, rosacea, melasma, angiomas
and spider angiomas, poikiloderma of Civatte, leg veins and venous malformations;

* The removal of unwanted hair from all skin types, and to effect stable long-term, or
permanent?, hair reduction in skin types I-V through selective targeting of melanin
in hair follicles.

Nd:YAG Laser Wavelength (1064 nm) is indicated for the coagulation and

hemostasis of vascular lesions and soft tissue, including:

* Treatment and clearance of superficial and deep telangiectasias (venulectasias) and
reticular veins (0.1 - 4.0 mm diameter) of the leg.

* Theremoval of unwanted hair from all skin types, and to effect stable long-term,
or permanent?, hair reduction in skin types I-V through selective targeting of
melanin in hair follicles.

The Real Time Chiller is indicated for use in cooling the epidermis at the treatment

site prior to, during and after light or laser treatment in general surgery, plastic

surgery and dermatology to:

* Reduce pain during and/or associated with light or laser treatment (via partial
anesthesia from cooling);

* Reduce discomfort during and/or associated with light or laser treatment;

* Minimize thermal injury, including thermal necrosis, to non-target skin and skin
structures during and/or associated with light or laser treatment, thus reducing
possible complications such as scabbing, scarring, hyper- and/or
hypopigmentation;

* Allow the use of higher light or laser fluences for light or laser treatments (such as
for hair removal and the treatment of vascular or pigmented lesions); and

+ Reduce potential side effects of light or laser treatments (such as for hair removal
and the treatment of vascular or pigmented lesions).

Vv. Rationale for Substantial Equivalence

The Lumenis Family of Intense Pulsed-Light (IPL) and IPL/Nd:Y AG laser systems

share the same general indications for use, and therefore is substantially equivalent

for use in surgical, aesthetic and cosmetic applications to the previously cleared IPL

and IPL/Nd:YAG family.

VI. Safety and Effectiveness Information
Clinical data was provided to demonstrate that the Lumenis Family of IPL and
IPL/Nd:YAG laser (1064 nm) systems are safe and effective, when indicated in

2 Permanent hair reduction is defined as a long-term stable reduction in the number of hairs

regrowing after a treatment regimen.

specific applications in the medical specialties of general and plastic surgery, and
dermatology.

VU. Conclusion
The Lumenis Family of Intense Pulsed-Light (IPL) and IPL/Nd:YAG laser systems
were shown to be substantially equivalent to the predicate devices cleared in
K020839. The Lumenis Family of Intense Pulsed-Light (IPL) and IPL/Nd:YAG laser
systems has identical intended use, as well as functional and design features as the
currently marketed predicate devices. The only change is expansion of labeled
indications for use, which fall within the scope of the intended use.

Dear Ms. Ruth:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
: devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
