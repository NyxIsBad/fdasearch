ablation, vaporization and coagulation of body soft tissues
including intraoral tissues. The use with the scanning unit is
indicated for ablative skin resurfacing.

Comparison: The Smart CO, Lasers are substantially equivalent to the Lumenis
UltraPulse Encore lasers and delivery device accessories . They :
are both CO2 lasers with a scanning unit as an accessory, for the
identical indications for use.

Nonclinical Performance Data: None

Clinical Performance Data: None
