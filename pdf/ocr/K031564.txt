Taunton, Ma. 02780
2. Device Name
Proprietary Name: CSS
Common Name: Coagulation Device
Classification Name: Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation device and

Stryker Serfac K991960
4. Device Description
The CSS is an accessory device that is intended to be used in conjunction with
currently marketed automated debrider systems and ESU’s the same as the current
MSI Bipolar Sheath. The CSS is designed to fit directly over various sizes of
straight automated debrider system blades. The CSS will be available in a variety
of diameters and in lengths. When the CSS is inserted over one of the debrider
blades, the device may be used to cauterize tissue. The CSS can be utilized to
provide spot coagulation or to coagulate tissue while the debrider blade is in
operation.
5. Intended Use
The CSS is intended to be used in conjunction with the powered debrider cutter
systems to cut and coagulate soft tissue during various arthroscopic surgical
procedures.

6. Comparison of Technological Characteristics
The CSS is substantially equivalent in design, materials, construction and
intended use as those of the predicates identified above. Since the CSS is the
same in intended use and technological characteristics as the predicate devices,
the CSS does not raise any new safety and efficacy concerns when compared to
these similar legally marketed devices. The differences in power have been
substantiated through applicable performance testing.
7. Performance Testing
Bench testing was conducted to determine device functionality and conformance
to design input requirements.

Dear Mr. Nardella:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device

You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class I] (PMA). it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations.affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including. but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
