510(k) Summary

Device Description

The disposable Cautery Tip Cleaner is a small 2” x 2” square polyurethane foam pad
which features a textile abrasive layer with an adhesive backing. A radiopaque strip
within the adhesive makes the device x-ray detectable. The adhesive backing allows for
universal placement as well as allowing the device to remain in place while the tip of the
electrosurgical cauterization device is “scratched” on the abrasive surface to remove
eschar buildup.

Intended Use
The disposable Cautery Tip Cleaner is a single use sterile product. Its

intended use is as an electrosurgical accessory to clean uncoated cautery

blades that are part of an electrosurgical pencil. The cautery blade is

“scratched” on the cautery tip cleaner to remove eschar build-up during

surgical procedures to allow the cautery blade to function effectively

throughout the procedure. The product is usually placed somewhere on the

sterile field, typically on the mayo stand. This product does not come in

contact with the patient.

Technological Characteristics Comparison

Xodus Medical Inc.’s cautery tip cleaner has the same physical characteristics, material
and design as the predicate device. The Xodus Medical Cautery Tip Cleaner is a 2” X 2”
x 4” square polyurethane foam pad featuring a textile abrasive layer with an adhesive
backing containing an x-ray detectable radiopaque strip. Aspen Surgicals’ Cautery Tip
Cleaner has the same design but is a little smaller measuring 14” x 14” x “4”. Both the
predicate device and Xodus Medicals’ device are used for the cleaning of electrosurgical
cautery tips during surgical procedures.

Dear Mr. Kaforey:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class I (Special Controls) or class I (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation contro! provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act): 21 CFR 1000-1050.
