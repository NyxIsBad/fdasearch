Description of the Device:

The Boston Scientific Electrosurgical System is comprised of three components: the Surgical
Probe, Electrosurgical Unit (ESU) and Instrument Cable. The Electrosurgical Unit measures
temperatures. from the thermocouples and uses the temperature measurements to regulate
radiofrequency power delivery to the electrodes. The ESU is a software-controlled monopolar
high frequency electronic instrument, provided with controls for set temperature, power limit,
and number of active electrodes. The ESU has readouts for temperature, time of energy
delivery, and delivered power. The ESU operates in a temperature controlled, power limited
manner, based on operator settings and temperature feedback provided by thermocouples in
the Surgical Probe. Front panel connectors include connections for the Instrument Cable, ESU
Remote Cable, and DIP electrodes.

The Surgical Probe is provided in a variety of models, ranging from 2 electrodes to 7 electrodes,
with either a malleable or flexible shaft that can be bent to the desired shape, providing
improved tissue contact and maneuverability in hard-to-reach areas. The Instrument Cable
connects the ESU to the Surgical Probe. Accessories included with the ESU include ESU Remote
Cable, Footswitch, Instrument Cable, and mains power cord.

Intended Use:

The Cobra® Cardiac Surgical Probe (Probe) is intended for the coagulation of cardiac tissue
using radiofrequency (RF) energy dtring cardiac surgery. The Probe can be used during
general surgery to coagulate soft tissues. The Probe may also be used to coagulate blood and
soft tissue to produce hemostasis.

Non-clinical Data:

This stibmission includes only an expanded indication for use, therefore there are no new issues
of safety or efficacy, and the previously documented performance reports are still valid and
applicable to the system. Specifically, previous non-clinical tests conducted for the Device
showed the device met its design-input criteria, and support substantial equivalence.
Additional testing showed the device to perform predictably (based on delivery temperature
and time) when compared to an equivalent device in an animal model.

Summary:

Based upon the design, materials, function, intended use, comparison with currently marketed
devices, and the non-clinical testing performed by Boston Scientific, the Tissue Coagulation
System ESU and Accessories has been shown to be substantially equivalent to currently
marketed predicate devices

Dear Ms. Ruth:
This letter corrects our substantially equivalent letter of July 11, 2002.
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices,
good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA),
it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be
found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Page 2 - Ms. Andrea L, Ruth
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to continue marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your
device to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0120. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
(240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/dsma/dsmamain.html
