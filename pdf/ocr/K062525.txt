K031011 LigaSure™ 5mm Laparoscopic Vatleylab, Inc.
Sealer/divider

Device description: |The Vessel Sealer/divider is an electrosurgical instrument for
use with the LigaSure™ Vessel Sealing Generator (not within
the scope of this submission). The device is able to seal
vessels, divide vessels and tissue clamped between its jaws,
grasp tissue, and is capable of blunt dissection. The diameter of
the shaft is 5mm and the working length is 37cm. Device
controls are located on the instrument handle. The instrument is
supplied sterile for single patient use.

Indications for Use: Reprocessed Vessel Sealer/dividers are bipolar electrosurgical
instruments intended for use with the LigaSure Generator in
general and gynecologic laparoscopic surgical procedures where
ligation and division of vessels is desired. The instrument creates
a seal by application of RF electrosurgical energy to vascular
structures (vessels) interposed between the jaws of the
instrument. A blade within the instrument is surgeon-actuated to
divide tissue.
indications for use include general laparoscopic procedures
including urologic, vascular, thoracic and thoracoscopic, and
gynecologic laparoscopic procedures where ligation and division
of vessels is performed, including such procedures as
laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy, Nissen
fundoplication, colectomy, adhesiolysis, oophorectomy, etc.

The LigaSure 5mm Vessel Sealer-Divider can be used on vessels

up to and including 7mm diameter, and bundles of tissue as large
as will fit in the jaws of the instrument.

Technological The design, materials, and intended use of Reprocessed Vessel

characteristics: Sealer/dividers are identical to the predicate devices. The
mechanism of action of Reprocessed Vessel Sealer/Dividers is
identical to the predicate devices in that the same standard
mechanical design, materials, and size are utilized. There are
no changes to the claims, intended use, clinical applications,
patient population, performance specifications, or method of
operation. In addition, Ascent Healthcare Solutions’s
reprocessing of Vessel Sealer/dividers includes removal of
adherent visible soil and decontamination. Each individual
Vessel Sealer/divider is tested for appropriate function of its
components prior to packaging and labeling operations.

Performance data: Bench and laboratory testing was conducted to demonstrate
performance (safety and effectiveness) of Reprocessed Vessel
Sealer/dividers. This included the following tests:

e Biocompatibility

e Validation of reprocessing

¢ Sterilization Validation

e Function test(s)

e Packaging Validation

Performance testing demonstrates that Reprocessed Vessel
Sealer/dividers perform as originally intended.

Conclusion: Ascent Healthcare Solutions concludes that the modified
devices (Reprocessed Vessel Sealer/dividers) are safe,
effective, and substantially equivalent to the predicate devices
as described herein.

Dear Ms. Barton:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for
use Stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce
prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good
manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class I! (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may

807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the
quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product
radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
