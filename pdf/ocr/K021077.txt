E. Applicant Device Description

: The Mega 2000 Soft Patient Return Electrode Pad is constructed ofa layer of conductive material strain-relieved with two sheets of urethane material, and —
sealed between two asymmetric layers of a viscoelastic polymer called Akton®.
(The top layer of polymer is thinner than the bottom layer.) The Akton polymer is
encapsulated by a layer of urethane film. A two conductor cable connects the
conductive layer of the device to a two conductor DetachaCable™. The
DetachaCable is connected to a standard monopolar electrosurgical unit (ESU).
The device cable is insulated and strain-relieved well inside the device to prevent
patient or user burns.
The device is large enough to extend at least the length and width of a typical
patient torso. Pad size is approximately 20” x 46” x 4”.
In use, this device will lay on an operating room table with the patient lying on
top, on the side labeled “patient side”.

F.. Applicant Device Intended Use .
The Mega 2000 Soft Patient Return Electrode Pad is to be used as a general

purpose return electrode and/or a pressure reduction pad in any surgical ,
application. Electrosurgical use is restricted to use with isolated monopolar
electrosurgical generators.

G. Technological Characteristics

: , The technological characteristics of the proposed device are identical to the
predicate devices.

H. Safety information
The only current flow from the patient to the Mega2000 Soft Patient Retum
Electrode Pad is via capacitive coupling. This device is designed to be current
limiting (<<100 mA/cm) so as to prevent the patient from getting return electrode

: site burns. This current limiting attribute is achieved by selecting materials with .
high impedance per area. 
_ The large contact area between the electrode and the patient lowers the total
impedance when there is substantial patient / pad contact area, and allows for
enough current flow for electrosurgery to be performed at the surgical site.

The use of Akton as a dielectric layer and a cushioning agent provides load
deflection to equalize and distribute pressure. The sofiness of the material also
reduces shear and friction, some of the chief causes of pressure sores. The

desirable attribute of this polymer is that it compresses but does not laterally move
under pressure, thus maintaining dielectric protection.
This device. conforms to the applicable sections of AAMI HF-18/2001.

Received: April 3, 2002
Dear Mr. Mosenkis:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
‘ You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
_ devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration. /
If your device is classified (see above) into either class I (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820), and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 53 1-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

. This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a elassification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market. ’
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 80land .
additionally 21 CFR Part 809.10 for in vitro diagnostic devices), please contact the Office of
Compliance at (301) 594-4659, Additionally, for questions on the promotion and advertising of
your device, please contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4639. Also, please note the
‘regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97).
Other general information on your responsibilities under the Act may be obtained from the
