RITA® Model 1500X Electrosurgical RF Generator
9.0 510K) SUMMARY OF sare AND EFFECTIVENESS
O319S7

General Trade Name: RITA® Model 1500X Electrosurgical RF Generator

Provisions Common/Classification Name: Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation device

Name of RITA Medical Systems Inc. —- Model 1500 & Model 2500 Electrosurgical RF

Predicate Generator

Classification Class 0

Performance Performance standards have not been established by the FDA under section 514 of

Standards the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.

Intended Use The Model 1500X Electrosurgical RF Generator and accessories are indicated for
use in percutaneous, laparoscopic, and intraoperative coagulation and ablation of
soft tissue, including the partial or complete ablation of non-resectable liver lesions
and the palliation of pain associated with metastatic lesions involving bone in
patients who have failed or are not candidates for standard pain therapy.

Device The Model 1500X Electrosurgical RF Generator is designed to provide monopolar

Description radiofrequency (RF) energy. The RF Generator is a 150/200 W electrosurgical

generator specifically designed for use with RITA electrosurgical devices. It can
read multiple temperature sensors and includes impedance and power monitoring to
assist the physician in monitoring and controlling the ablation.
To use the system, the RF Generator is plugged into the wall outlet via the Power
Cord. The electrosurgical device is connected to the RF Generator via the Main
Cable. The Dispersive Electrode is place on the appropriate location of the body
and is connected to its port on the RF Generator. Once the system is successfully
powered up, the user can set the parameters of the ablation such as the mode of
operation, the ablation time, the target temperature, and the power delivery level.
With the electrosurgical device placed in the tissue to be ablated and its electrodes
deployed, RF power can be turned on. The system parameters are continuously
monitored and displayed on the RF Generator. If the measured parameters are
outside the acceptable limits, the RF energy delivery automatically stops and a
message appears on the liquid crystal display (LCD). The RF energy delivery also
automatically ceases once the ablation is completed based on the initial userdefined parameters. RF energy can be stopped at any time by pressing the RF
ON/OFF switch.

Performance The Model 1500X RF Generator was subjected to a battery of electrical,

Data mechanical, and software validation testing. /

Dear Ms. Klinker:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legaily marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class HI (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does net mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
“Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
