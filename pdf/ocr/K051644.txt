Trade or Proprietary Name:
Valleylab ForceTriad™ Electrosurgical Generator
Common Name: Electrosurgical Generator
Classification Name:
e Class Il, 21 CFR 878.4400, Electrosurgical Cutting and Coagulation Device
and Accessories, Panel 79, General and Plastic Surgery
¢ Class Il, 21 CFR 884.4120, Gynecologic Electrocautery and Accessories
3. Predicate Devices
The ForceTriad™ Electrosurgical Generator is substantially equivalent in function
and intended use to the following legally marketed devices: Valleylab Force FX™
Electrosurgical Generator (K944602) and the Valleylab LigaSure™ Vessel Sealing
System (K981916). The ForceTriad™ generator and the Force FX™ generator
both have monopolar and bipolar electrosurgical outputs and are intended for ail
types of surgical procedures where electrosurgery is desired. Both have a selection
of CUT and COAG monopolar outputs, and can be used with conventional
electrosurgical devices. The ForceTriad™ generator has an additional monopolar
output, Hemostasis with Division, that allows the surgeon to maintain controlled
hemostasis while dividing tissue. The HWD output has power output and maximum
voltage output in the same range as the other monopolar outputs. It is available
when using the Valleylab G3000 electrosurgical device.
The ForceTriad™ generator and the LigaSure™ vessel sealing generator both have
outputs for LigaSure™ vessel sealing devices. The output power and voltage of the
generators are equivalent.
4. Device Description
The ForceTriad™ generator is a full-featured electrosurgical generator with
monopolar, bipolar, and Valleylab LigaSure™ vessel sealing outputs. The generator

. kos 164s lage 29@
is an electrically isolated, microcontroller-based device, incorporating closed-loop
control for all output modes implemented in the microcontroller firmware. The
generator incorporates Instant Response™ technology to constantly measure the
electrical impedance of the tissue and instantaneously adjust the generator output to
maintain the desired power.

Available output modes include:

Monopolar

¢ Cut: clean, precise cut in tissue, with little or no hemostasis

* Blend: blended waveform for slower cutting and additional hemostasis

« Hemostasis with division (HWD): optimized division of tissue with controlled
hemostasis and minimal thermal damage to adjacent tissue

¢ Fulgurate: tissue coagulation by sparking

¢ Spray: fulguration with shallower penetration over larger tissue areas

Bipolar

« Low: precise, controlled desiccation of tissue

¢ Standard: general bipolar desiccation with consistent tissue effect

e Macro: rapid coagulation and bipolar cutting in a wide range of tissues

LigaSure™ vessel sealing

¢ Seals vessels (arteries, veins, lymph) 7mm and less, and tissue bundles.

The monopolar Cut, Blend, Fulgurate, and Spray output modes are designed for use

with conventional handswitching or footswitching electrosurgical devices. The three

bipolar output modes are designed for use with conventional handswitching or

footswitching electrosurgical bipolar forceps. When using conventional

electrosurgical devices, the user selects the mode and desired power using a touch

screen display on the generator.

All monopolar output modes, including HWD, are also designed for use with

Valleylab electrosurgical devices with surgeon power control. The surgeon power

control devices utilize Valleylab Smart™ connector technology that allows the

generator to identify the type of device in use. After recognizing the device type, the

generator establishes five power zones for each output mode. The generator

defaults to power zone 3, but the surgeon may select an alternate power zone using

the touch screen. From the sterile field, the surgeon then uses the slider switch on

the device to select the desired power setting within the selected power zone. The

surgeon activates the desired output mode (CUT, HWD, COAG) using the buttons

on the device. The surgeon also has the option of using the touch screen controls

to select power levels outside the pre-established power zones to accommodate

unusual surgical situations. :

Monopolar electrosurgery requires the use of a patient return electrode (“return pad”

or “grounding pad”) with Valleylab REM™ return electrode monitoring. The REM™

system continuously verifies contact between the patient and pad to prevent pad
site burns. (Valleylab REM™ electrodes were initially cleared for marketing on

K822572, and have been used on all Valleylab electrosurgical generators since that

ot

time.) Bipolar devices and LigaSure™ vessel sealing devices do not require patient

return electrodes.

The ForceTriad™ vessel sealing mode is designed for use with LigaSure™ vessel

sealing devices. The LigaSure™ devices utilize Smart™ connector technology to

allow the generator to recognize the device in use and set the generator output
accordingly. (Refer to K981916, LigaSure™ Vessel Sealing System.)
5. Intended Use

The ForceTriad™ generator is a full-featured electrosurgical generator intended for

open and laparoscopic surgical procedures where the surgeon requires

electrosurgical cutting, coagulation, or vessel sealing (tissue fusion) in general,
urologic, thoracic, plastic and reconstructive, arthroscopic, gynecologic and similar
surgery. The ForceTriad™ generator is intended for use in the operating room,
surgery center, or clinic. The generator has both monopolar and bipolar outputs that
accommodate standard electrosurgical devices and Valleylab electrosurgical
devices with surgeon power control. The ForceTriad™ generator also incorporates
the functionality of the Vatleylab LigaSure™ vessel sealing system, and accepts

Valleylab LigaSure™ devices.

Valleylab makes the following recommendations with regard to the use of the

ForceTriad™ electrosurgical generator.

« Use electrosurgery with caution in the presence of internal or external
pacemakers, Interference produced by the use of electrosurgical devices can
cause a pacemaker to enter an asynchronous mode or can block the pacemaker
effect entirely. Consult the pacemaker manufacturer or hospital Cardiology
Department for further information when use of electrosurgical or tissue fusion
appliances is planned in patients with cardiac pacemakers.

e Ifthe patient has an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), contact the ICD
manufacturer for instructions before performing an electrosurgical or tissue
fusion procedure. Electrosurgery or tissue fusion may cause multiple activations
of ICDs.

Valleylab recommends against the use of laparoscopic surgery on pregnant

patients.

LigaSure™ tissue fusion has not been shown to be effective for tubal sterilization or

tubal coagulation for sterilization procedures. Do not use this function for these

procedures.
6. Summary of Technological Characteristics
