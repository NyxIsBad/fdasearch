§10(k) SUMMARY (As Required per 21 CFR 807.92(c))
DEVICE OPERATION: .
The Bovie IDS-400 (the Generator) operates by delivering high frequency radiofrequency (RF)
energy which, when used in conjunction with other electrosurgical accessories, is used to cut and
coagulate tissue. There is a characteristic electrical wave form associated with each mode. The
electrical properties of the waveform (frequency and duration) produce the clinical effect (1.¢. cut,
coagulation). The shape and duration of waveforms arc comparable between the generator and
predicate devices.
The Generator functions in any of six user selectable modes:
Monopolar Cut I/II The cut modes allow the user to utilize electrosurgical current to
vaporize or cut tissue.
Blend: The monopolar cutting speed and degree of hemostasis is controlled by the
Monopolar blend control.
Coagulation (Pinpoint): Coagulation, also referred to as pinpoint coagulation, is used
with forceps, blade, or needle electrodes and endoscopic devices. Coagulation is
intended for use of small defined tissue areas. Coagulation is used to activate the
generator prior to contacting tissue. Once the desired effect is achieved, the electrode is
removed from the tissue area and deactivated. This coagulation mode provides precise
control of bleeding in localized areas.
Fulguration (Spray Coagulation): Fulguration, also referred to as spray coagulation
provides greater control of bleeding in highly vascularized tissues over broad surface
areas. This mode is used with all types of pencil electrodes, endoscopic devices and
clamps. Areas are repeatedly sprayed until desired hemostasis is established and can be
used on all types of tissue.
Bipolar: The bipolar procedure is activated when performing coagulation with bipolar
forceps.
The generator is designed to comply with applicable Medical Electrical Equipment safety
standards, including electromagnetic compatibility and other safety standards.
The Generator uses technology substantially cquivalent to the Aaron. IDS-300 Electrosurgical
Generator (K022856). There are no new hazards presented with the use of the Bovie IDS-400
Electrosurgical Generator as compared with the predicate device.
INTENDED USE:
The Bovie IDS-400 Electrosurgical Generator is a non-sterile, reusable multi-purpose
electrosurgical generator that is designed to perform monopolar and bipolar functions in the
operating arena. .

Dear Mr. Kozloff:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
. may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements conceming your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act), 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 — Mr. Richard A. Kozloff
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance
at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address
