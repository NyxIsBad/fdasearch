We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device

You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of

CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
