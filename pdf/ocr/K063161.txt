will now be offered with new gel NH 04, in otherwise the grounding plates are equivalent to the materials of
construction used in the Skintact® Cool Contact Electrosurgical Grounding Plates (the manufacturer’s
predicate device) cleared via 510(k) [K030362]. The Skintact® Cool Contact Electrosurgical Grounding
