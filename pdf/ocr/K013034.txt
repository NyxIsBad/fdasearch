Device Name: ThermaCool IIA j
Common Name(s): RF Unit, coagulator :
Classification Name: Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation device and accessories
Establishment Name & Registration Number:
Name: Thermage
Number: 2954746
Classification:
Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations,
§ 878.4400 Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation device and accessories. (a) Identification. An
electrosurgical cutting and coagulation device and accessories is a device intended to remove tissue and control
bleeding by use of high-frequency electrical current. (b) Classification. Class IL.
ProCode: 79GEI
Equivalent Device(s):
The modified ThermaCool ILA claims substantial equivalence to the ThermaCool and ThermaCool If
(K000944 & K003183).
Description of the Device:
The Thermage ThermaCool IIA device consists of the same four principal components as the ThermaCool and
ThermaCool II as reviewed under the referenced earlier premarket notifications. The four principal components
are:
as Thermage ThermaCool IIA RF Generator
as Thermage ThermaCool IIA Handpiece Connection Module
ee Thermage ThermaCool IIA RF Cooling Module
es Thermage ThermaCool IIA RF Handpiece Assembly
The device generates radio frequency (RF) energy and operates in either monopolar or bipolar mode as selected
by the user. The device continuously monitors output power, output energy, treatment duration, and measured
impedance. When used in monopolar mode, a commercially available dispersive patient retum electrode is
utilized, When used in bipolar mode, the current retums via the handpiece insert tip and no dispersive electrode
is needed. The handpiece attaches to the unit via an industry standard BNC type connector. As before, the
intended use of the device is for use in dermatologic and general surgical procedures for electrocoagulation and
hemostasis.
The system has been modified and now includes a heating element and a new cryogen metering valve within the
handpiece. The effect of the change is improving cryogen flow characteristics in the clinical setting.

and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
