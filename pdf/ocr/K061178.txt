Dear Ms. Juckett:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the
device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent to
legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976,
the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments or to devices that have been
reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
(Act). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of
the Act. However, you are responsible to determine that the medical devices you use as
components in the [kit/tray] have either been determined as substantially equivalent under
the premarket notification process (Section 510(k) of the act), or were legally on the
market prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments.
Please note: If you purchase your device components in bulk (i.e., unfinished) and further
process (e.g., sterilize) you must submit a new 510(k) before including these components
in your kit/tray. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for
annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, and labeling, and
prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III
(PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your
device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In
addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal
Register.

Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not
mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other
requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other
Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not
limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good
manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21
CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions
(Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section
; 510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device
to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus,
permits your device to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on the labeling regulation, please contact the
Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
“Misbranding by reference to premarket notification”(21 CFR Part 807.97). You may
obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division
of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll free number
(800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150, or at its Internet address
