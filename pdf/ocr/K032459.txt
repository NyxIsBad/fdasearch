Device Trade Name: Profile 1320 Laser System

Common Name: Nd:YAG Laser System

Classification Name: Laser Surgical Instrument, 21 CFR 878.4810.

Legally Marketed Profile 1320 Laser System (K022466, K022381)

Predicate Device: CoolTouch Nd:YAG Laser System (K031184, KO30453
K022817, KO14035 and K012982)

Profile 1320 Laser System: emission at a wavelength of 1320 nm. It consists of a laser
console, interna! computer, control panel and display, an
optical delivery system comprised of an articulated arm
and a handpiece or scanner with cooling capability, and a
footswitch.

Intended Use: The Sciton, Inc. Profile 1320 Laser is intended for use in
general surgery and dermatology for the incision, excision,
ablation, vaporization, coagulation, with hemostasis of soft
tissue. It is indicated for the treatment of fine lines and
wrinkles. {t is also indicated for the treatment of back acne
and atrophic acne scars.

Rationale for Substantial The Profile 1320 Laser System shares the same

Equivalence: indications for use, similar design features (including
wavelength, laser medium, power supply, cooling and
control system), functional features (including power
output, repetition rate, energy, spot size and fluence), and

is therefore substantially equivalent to the above legally
marketed predicate devices.

Safety and Effectiveness The indications for use are based upon the indications for

Information use for predicate systems. Technologically, the Profile
4320 Laser System is substantially equivalent to the listed
predicate devices. Therefore, the risks and benefits for the
Profile 1320 Laser System are comparable to the predicate
devices.

Conclusion The Profile 1320 shares similar indications for use, design
features, and similar functional features as, and therefore
is substantially equivalent to, the currently marketed
predicate devices.
