Device Name:
Nucleotomy Catheter :
Device Description:

, The Nucleotomy Catheter is a minimally invasive thermoelectric device. When used in
conjunction with the ORA-50 S Generator the Nucleotomy Catheter delivers thermal energy to
targeted locations inside the disc. The distal portion of the tip is flexible such that the device can
maneuver through disc anatomy. The flexible tip contains a resistive metal coil, which produces
heat when current flows through it. The device contains a thermocouple for monitoring and

; controlling the temperature of the treated tissue.

Indications for Use:

The Nucleotomy Catheter is intended to be used for the coagulation and decompression of dise
material to treat symptomatic patients with contained herniated discs.

Predicate Device:

SpineCATH Intradiscal Catheter K993967, cleared December 28, 1999

Safety and Performance

Performance and biocompatibility testing were conducted to support this claim of substantial
equivalence.

Conclusion

The Nucleotomy Catheter has the same technological characteristics and similar intended use as the
predicate device. Results of the performance and biocompatibility testing, as presented in this premarket notification, demonstrate that the Nucleotomy Catheter is substantially equivalent to the
predicate device. /

j Dear Ms. Guthrie:

: We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and we have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the
indications for use stated in the enclosure) to devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to
May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have
been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
(Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices,
good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA’s issuance ofa substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CER Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
