Radiancy Acne System with ClearTouch™ Light Unit Assembly
ClearLight Phototherapy System, Model CT 420
Intended Use / Indications for Use
The Radiancy Acne System with ClearTouch™ Light Unit Assembly (“Radiancy
Acne System”) is intended to provide phototherapeutic light to the body. The Radiancy
Acne System is generally indicated to treat dermatological conditions. The Radiancy
Acne System is specifically indicated to treat mild to moderate inflammatory acne
vulgaris which includes pustular inflammatory acne, in patients with Fitzpatrick skin types
I-VI.
Technological Characteristics
The ClearTouch LUA is mounted on the hand piece of Radiancy’s SpaTouch
Photoepilation System (the “SpaTouch’), or on the hair removal / acne hand piece of
Radiancy’s SkinStation (the “SkinStation’), in order to treat acne vulgaris (the “Radiancy
Acne System”). The Radiancy Acne System consists of two green-coated flash lamps.
The Radiancy Acne System produces a wavelength spectrum of 430 — 1100 nm with a
pulse duration of 35 msec and has a spot size of 22 x 55 mm.
Substantial Equivalence
The Radiancy Acne System has the same intended use and very similar
indications for use, principles of operation and technological characteristics as the
Radiancy Acne System with ClearTouch™ Light Unit Assembly and the ClearLight
Phototherapy System, Model CL 420 (‘ClearLight System”). The minor differences
between the Radiancy Acne System and the ClearLight System do not raise new issues
of safety and effectiveness. Clinical data demonstrates that the Radiancy Acne System
treats mild to moderate inflammatory acne vulgaris in all skin types with only minor side
effects. Thus, the Radiancy Acne System is substantially equivalent.

Dear Mr. Kahan, Esq:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
/ You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class IIT (PMA),
it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device
can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA
may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 — Mr. Jonathan S. Kahan, Esq. .
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your
device to proceed to the market. If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
