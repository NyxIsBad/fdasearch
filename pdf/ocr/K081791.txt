Common Name: Device, electrosurgical, cutting & coagulation &
accessories
Trade Name: E-Z Clean electrosurgical electrodes
Classification (if known): 21 CFR 878.4400, Electrosurgical cutting and
coagulation device and accessories
E, Predicate Devices
The predicate devices include American Medical Products’ E-Z Clean Cautery Tip
which was cleared for marketing via 510(k) # K862221 by FDA’s Office of Device
Evaluation on August 11, 1986; and Utah Medical Products’ Epitome® Scalpel
electrode with ZapGuard™ which was cleared for marketing via 510(k) #K960255 on
March 27, 1996.
F. Applicant Device Description
The Megadyne E-Z Clean electrosurgical electrode is a monopolar electrosurgical
electrode that is coated with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). It is insulated over the
majority of its exposed length. It is intended for general electrosurgical use, and is
designed to fit into and work in conjunction with an industry standard hand- or footactivated electrosurgical pencil which is connected to an electrosurgical unit or ESU.
This device is supplied sterile and is not intended to be reused.
The E-Z Clean electrosurgical electrodes are available in a number of tip
configurations and lengths. Tips such as standard blades, modified blades, needles,
blunt needles, ball-ends, and others are typical.
Some tip configurations (ACE blades) contain a slightly different geometry that will
enhance the affects of the generator’s Advanced Cutting Effect (ACE) Mode. In this
mode, the blade will make skin incisions without the blanching or thermal damage
commonly seen with standard electrosurgery. The new E-Z Clean ACE Blade
provides a wound site that will heal similar to a scalpel wound (comparable
Histopathology) when used in conjunction with the ACE mode. When not being used
. to perform skin incisions the ACE Blade functions as a standard E-Z Clean blade in
all cutting and coagulating modes.
This submission also includes the option of a guard or nosecone on some
configurations of electrodes. This nose cone provides additional dielectric protection
at the junction where the E-Z Clean electrosurgical electrode is connected to an
electrosurgical pencil.
G. Applicant Device Intended Use
E-Z Clean electrosurgical electrodes are intended to conduct radio frequency (RF)
current for cutting and coagulation from the electrosurgical generator to target soft

tissue in a broad range of surgical procedures requiring the use of electrosurgery for
cutting and cauterization.
Some tip configurations have a specific geometry that minimizes blanching and
thermal damage in skin incisions when used in conjunction with the generator’s
Advanced Cutting Effect (ACE) mode.
H. Technological Characteristics
The proposed device shares the same technological characteristics found in the
predicate devices. It is an electrosurgical electrode intended for electrosurgical cutting
and coagulation.
I. Safety information
Questions of safety and effectiveness are the same for this device as they are for the
predicate devices and other electrosurgical electrodes on the market. There are no
new technologies incorporated into the device.
Megadyne has conducted extensive testing to ensure conformance to the voluntary
standard ISO 60601-2-2:2006, Medical electrical equipment, Part 2: Particular
requirements for the safety of high frequency surgical equipment, and ANSI / AAMI
HF 18-2001, Electrosurgical Devices.

Regulation Name: Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation device and accessories
Regulatory Class: II
Product Code: GEI
Dated: October 9, 2008
Received: October 10, 2008
Dear Ms. Magneson:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CEFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050. .

Page 2 - Ms. Ronda K. Magneson
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at :
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance
at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address
