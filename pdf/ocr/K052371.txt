Depilite EL-8b Series DERMO FLASH™ Systems

MED-OP Aesthetic Technologies, Ltd.

March 20, 2006

Description of the DERMO FLASH™ Series Devices:
The Depilite EL-8b Series DERMO FLASH™ devices are microprocessorcontrolled nonablative light-based medical devices which use pulsed xenon lamps
to deliver a selectable range of polychromatic light outside the range of harmful
ultraviolet wavelengths leaving only the visual and infrared light to be presented
for photo thermolysis epilation and skin treatments. Pre-set and manual delivery
parameters — such as the appropriate wavelength, energy, pulse rate and exposure
time — and other system features are modulated from the display and control panel
on the main unit. The corresponding fluence is delivered through an air-cooled
double lamp hand piece without making contact with the treated area (Non
Contact Pulsed Light or NCPL™). The complete system consists of the Depilite
EL-8b DERMO FLASH™ machine, a photothermolysis handle with treatment
head, keys for main switch, a foot switch, electric power cable, protective
goggles, and instruction manual.
The Depilite EL-8b Series DERMO FLASH™ devices are in compliance with
mandatory special controls as required by 21 C.F.R. Part 1040 — Performance
Standards for Light-Emitting Products.

Indications for Use:
The Depilite EL-8b Series DERMO FLASH™ Systems are microprocessorcontrolled nonablative light-based medical devices designed for permanent hair
reduction, and the treatment of vascular and benign pigmented lesions and
inflammatory acne, on skin types I-IV.

Substantial Equivalency:
The differences in specifications of the Depilite EL-8b Series DERMO FLASH™
devices and the predicate device(s) do not result in different performances or raise
new questions of safety or efficacy.

Conclusion:
The Depilite EL-8b Series DERMO FLASH™ Systems are substantially
equivalent to other legally-marketed flash light-based medical devices in U.S.
commercial distribution for the same dermatological applications.

Dear Mr. Mitchell:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Page 2 — Mr. Craig A. Mitchell :
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
(301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/dsma/dsmamain html
