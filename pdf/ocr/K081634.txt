Device Description: The CONMED GoldVac Integrated Smoke Evacuation Pencils a
sterile, single use integrated electrosurgical pencil and smoke evacuation handpiece. The
device is intended for general electrosurgical applications and when used in conjunction
withan effective smoke evacuation system, for removing smoke generated by
electrosurgery.

The integration of the pencil and the smoke attachment allows a single device to be used.
The need for smoke removal is demonstrated in numerous studies documenting the
effects of surgical smoke. It has been well documented the smoke produced from
electrosurgery contains carbonized tissue, airborne particles, and various chemicals and
gases. The Occupational Health And Safety Administration has issued recommendations
that surgical smoke be removed and properly filtered by a smoke evacuation system as
close to the surgical site as possible. The traditional surgical mask has been determined
to be not adequate for personal protection. The device is constructed of thermoplastics
well known throughout the industry in the manufacture of medical devices. The device
consists of electrosurgical pencil with an integrated pathway for smoke removal. This
pathway forms an airway from the tip to the rear of the pencil. The pencil is connected to
tubing which will be attached to the rear of a variety of smoke evacuation systems. The
smoke is then filtered by smoke evacuation system preventing personnel exposure to this
surgical smoke. The device will be packaged singly for sterile distribution.

The CONMED" GoldVac Integrated Smoke Evacuation Pencil incorporates an
extendable “smoke tube” which is housed within the electrosurgical pencil. The pencil is
connected to the 10 feet of tubing which connects the pencil to the smoke evacuation
system.
Technological Characteristics: The CONMED GoldVac Integrated Smoke Evacuation
Pencils are simply an integration of the electrosurgical pencil and the smoke evacuation
attachment. The only visible difference is this integration and the addition of a “smoke
tube” which can be positioned near the tip of the electrode for maximum smoke removal
or farther back for maximum accessibility and visibility.
The tubing houses the cord set to eliminate clutter at the surgical site and swivels to allow
for a maximum range of motion.
The technological characteristics of the electrosurgical pencil remain the same. As with
the predicate device, CUT, COAG, and smoke evacuations are contained in one device,
limiting the need for several devices present at the surgical site that perform these
functions independently of each other.
The proposed device is equivalent to the identified predicate devices with respect to
technological characteristics and function. The device has been designed to comply with
the applicable sections of ANSI/AAMI American National Standard for Electrosurgical
Devices HF-18, the International Electrotechnical Commission Standard for
Electrosurgical Devices, 60601-2-2, Risk Management ISO 14971 and Biocompatibility
ISO 10993.
« There are no changes to the generator and therefore no changes to the
accompanying software.
« The operator controls the use of the device;
* The generator provides alarms for conditions that could pose a risk to the patient;
* The operator sets the appropriate mode and output settings for the device.
Performance testing: Bench testing on the subject device has shown the device to
perform as intended with the same or similar results as a predicate device. No particular
requirements peculiar to this smoke performance exist in the standards but tests
conducted with the device have shown no effect or changes to the function of the
electrosurgical pencil. The removal of smoke was similar to that of the two independent
devices. The nozzle or intake portion of the device has been designed so as to not impede
the operation of the electrosurgical function of the pencil and provides for intake of the
surgical smoke for filtering
Intended Use: The GoldVac pencils, when used with an effective smoke evacuation
system, removes smoke plume from the surgical site. The pencil enables the operator to
remotely conduct an electrosurgical current from the output connector of an
electrosurgical unit to the operative site for the desired surgical effect.
Summary: The CONMED» GoldVac’ Integrated Smoke Evacuation Pencil is equivalent
to the identified predicate devices. In addition, it is equivalent in its intended use and
indications for use.

Dear Mr. Lehtonen:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to. the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class H (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
