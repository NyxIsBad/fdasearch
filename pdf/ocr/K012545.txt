Predicate Devices
Palomar Medical Technologies, Inc. Aramis Dermatologic Laser
Intended Use
The Aramis is intended to be used for incision/excision, ablation, and
, coagulation (homeostasis) of soft tissue. The Aramis Laser is also indicated
for the photocoagulation of dermatological vascular lesions, including
photothermolysis of blood vessels (treatment of facial and leg veins) and the
treatment of benign pigmented lesions.
Technological Characteristics and Substantial Equivalence
The Aramis Dermatologic Laser is an Er-glass 1.54 pm system. The
computer system consists of a laser unit, a cooler, a footswitch, and a 2mm or
4mm hand piece. The 4mm hand piece is gas-cooled to provide actual skin
cooling. Laser parameters and other system features are controlled from the
touch-buttons on top of the laser unit, which provides an interface to the
system computer.
The Aramis is substantially equivalent to the currently marketed Palomar
Aramis Dermatologic Laser powered surgical lasers in intended use,
indications for use, principles of operation, and technological features. Any
minor differences do not raise any new issues of safety or effectiveness.
. Performance Data

The Aramis complies with 21 C.F.R. §§ 1040.10 and 1040.11, as well as the
following voluntary performance standards:

e UL544; Electrical Leakage

e IEC 60-601-1; Power Supply and Enclosure

e IEC 60-825-01; Safety of Laser Product

e IEC 601-2-22; Therapeutic Laser Equipment Safety

Dear Mr. Kahan:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 — Mr. Jonathan S. Kahan, Esq.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.

additionally 21 CFR Part 809.10 for in vitro diagnostic devices), please contact the Office of
Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Additionally, for questions on the promotion and advertising of
