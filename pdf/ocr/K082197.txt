K073111 Portrait? PSR® System
Device Description
The Portrait? PSR° System is an electro-surgical device for use in dermatological
applications. The effect of the device is achieved by heating the outer layer of the skin so
that part or all of the epidermis becomes non-viable and there is controlled damage to
the underlying dermis. Similar biological changes are produced as with established
laser-based and RF-based dermatological surgical and skin resurfacing technologies.
The system includes: /
e Portrait PSR* Generator - a mobile unit comprising a trolley and lift-out
section referenced to as a “generator section”. Treatment parameters are
displayed on the control panel. The unit is powered by a 110/230 VAC
standard wall socket.
¢ Footswitch - single pedal unit for activation
e Handpiece and Cable Assembly — carries RF power and Nitrogen gas to the
Nozzle.

kK o8 Qld]
Rese fag 2.4
e Treatment Pack comprising a disposable Nozzle that is connected to the
Handpiece and an electronic “treatment pack key” that is used by the
generator to ensure the Nozzle is not used beyond its validated operational
life. The instrument does not touch the skin during treatment.
e Nitrogen Gas Cylinder - the gas is provided in a cylinder housed in the
generator enclosure. Refill cylinders containing the required purity of Nitrogen
are obtained by the user from a commercial gas supplier.
Indications for Use Statement
The Portrait? PSR® System is intended for treatment of the following dermatological
conditions:

¢ Treatment of wrinkles and rhytides

« Superficial skin lesions

* Actinic Keratosis

¢ Viral Papillomata

e Seborrhoeic Keratosis

« Acne Scars
The indications have not been changed from the cleared submission, KO73111.
Technological Characteristics
The technology involved in the Portrait? PSR® System has not been changed.
UHF energy from the generator converts Nitrogen gas into plasma within the Handpiece.
The plasma emerges from the Nozzle at the distal end of the Handpiece and is directed
onto the skin to be treated. Rapid heating of the skin occurs as the excited gas gives up
energy to the skin. Through the combination within the Handpiece of precisely controlled
energy and Nitrogen gas, plasma pulses are produced that will give predictable tissue
effects.
The Portrait? PSR° System with the modified software and hardware provides a 4 Joule
treatment as two consecutive pulses within 40 milliseconds. This is an additional menu
selection that supplements the current mode of supplying 4 Joules as one continuous
pulse in 15.4 milliseconds.
Substantial Equivalence Comparison
The Portrait® PSR* System with the modification is equivalent to the Portrait? PSR?
System cleared in KO73111. The modified software and hardware provide an alternative
method of delivering a 4 Joule treatment pulse.
Clinical and Non-Clinical Data
Tests were conducted using a calorimeter to measure the energy delivered. The
modified mode provides 4 Joules within the product specification.

Dear Mr. Zoletti:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class IIT (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register,
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
/ that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic~
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050,

Page 2 — Mr. Robert Zoletti
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, “Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance
at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address
