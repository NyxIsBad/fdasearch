4. Device Description
The Portrait® PSR® is an electro-surgical device for use in dermatological
applications. UHF energy from the generator converts Nitrogen gas into plasma
within the handpiece. The plasma emerges from the nozzle at the distal end of
the handpiece and is directed onto the skin to be treated. Rapid heating of the
skin occurs as the excited gas gives up energy to the skin. Through the
combination within the handpiece of precisely controlled energy and Nitrogen
gas, individual plasma pulses are produced that will give predictable tissue
effects.
