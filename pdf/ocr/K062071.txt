Description of Submitted Device:

The PROMETEY ™ diode laser system is a device for delivering laser power to treated
surfaces within oral cavity. This power is produced by solid-state laser diodes, which provide
a consistent generation of laser power in 810 + 10 nm spectral region with maximum power
of 3 Watts. The laser power is delivered to the treatment site by means of fiber optic cables
available in 400, 300 and 200 um core diameters. These cables provide safe transmission of
laser power to the surgical site without creating undue risk to a patient or operatory staff by
errant or collateral laser emissions. The device features front-panel keypad used to activate
650 nm aiming beam, set power output and select continuous or pulsed operation mode.

The distal end of delivery fiber cable is contained within a metal handpiece with a
disposable tip /cannula. A standard foot-switch controls initiation /termination of laser power
from the delivery fiber.

Intended Use of PROMETEY Soft Tissue Diode Laser:
The device is intended to be used for a variety of surgical procedures in the oral cavity:
Dental Soft Tissue Indications for incision, excision, vaporization, ablation and coagulation ‘
of oral soft tissues, including:
Excision and Incision Biopsies, Hemostasis and Coagulation, Treatment of canker sores,
herpetic and aphthous ulcers, Frenectomy and Frenotomy, Gingival Incision and Excision,
5-1

Gingivectomy and Gingivoplasty, Incision and Drainage of Abscess, Operculectomy, Oral
Papillectomy, Removal of Fibromas and Hyperplastic tissues, Exposure of un-erupted /
partially erupted teeth, Implant recovery, Tissue retraction / troughing, Leukoplakia,
Pulpotomy, Soft tissue crown lengthening, Vestibuloplasty.
Laser Periodontal Procedures, including:
Laser soft tissue curettage, Removal of highly inflamed edematous tissue affected by bacteria
penetration of the pocket lining and junctional epithelium, Sulcular debridement (removal of
diseased, infected, inflamed and necrosed soft tissue in the periodontal pocket to improve
clinical indices including gingival index, gingival bleeding index, probe depth, attachment
loss and tooth mobility).
Teeth Whitening Procedures, including:
Light Activation of bleaching materials for teeth whitening, Laser-assisted whitening /
bleaching of teeth.

for use in oral environment, similar design features including wavelength, operating controls,
and laser power delivery method. The devices share similar methods of control systems,
safety features, and performance monitoring. The devices share similar performance
specifications except for maximum power output, which is the lowest for Prometey laser but
is still enough to perform all Indications for Use since their laser power requirements are
below 3 Watts.

Summary Basis of Equivalence:
There are no unique applications, indications for use, materials or specifications presented
herein. Evidence of substantial equivalence has been demonstrated through:
© The PROMETEY ™ intended use and indications for use were previously cleared by
FDA for the predicate devices.
¢ The technical characteristics of Prometey diode laser are similar to those of cleared
Odyssey 2.4G, LaserSmile and SoftLase diode laser systems.
¢ Laser power output values of Prometey are well within previously cleared values of
predicate dental laser systems as described.
© The predicate devices and other previously FDA cleared diode laser systems with
similar power outputs have a proven safety and effectiveness in the treatment of the
claimed indications.
e Safety and performance testing.
Therefore, the PROMETEY ™ soft tissue diode laser system is substantially equivalent to its
predicate devices cited above and raises no new safety and/or effectiveness issues. The device
is designed to fully comply with relevant federal and international safety and performance
standards.

Trade/Device Name: PROMETEY™
Regulation Number: 21 CFR 878.4810
Regulation Name: Laser surgical instrument for use in general and plastic surgery and
in dermatology
Regulatory Class: II
Product Code: GEX .
Dated: July 17, 2006
Received: July 24, 2006
Dear Mr. Bekov:
This letter corrects our substantially equivalent letter of September 28, 2006.
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices,
good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class Ill (PMA), it
may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be
found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to continue marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
