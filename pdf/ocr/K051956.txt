5. Description:
Dr. OPPEL ST-501 is a electrosurgical unit using high frequency current to cut and/or
coagulate tissue. It consists of Electrosurgical Unit generator, Handpiece, Electrodes, a cable
for disposable patient plate and foot switch. It is a compact source of high power RF energy to
be employed for a variety of radiosurgery procedures. This action is achieved by front panel
selection of power level and time. All selection is effected through push buttons and lamps
that give the operator feedback of status. The final output power control is made through foot
and/or hand switches.
Both Monopolar and Bipolar electrodes are provided. Monopolar electrodes have needle, ball,
loop and blade types. Electrodes are supplied non-sterile and reusable.
6. Indication for use:
Dr. OPPEL ST-501 is intended for the removal and destruction of skin legions and the
coagulation of tissue. Non-sterile and reusable electrodes are used in conjunction with an
electrosurgical handpiece and generator.

Trade/Device Name: Dr. OPPEL ST-501
Regulation Number: 21 CFR 878.4400
Regulation Name: Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation device and accessories
Regulatory Class: II
Product Code: GEI
Dated: August 22, 2005
Received: August 25, 2005
Dear Mr. Mouser:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2- Mr. Marc M. Mouser
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k}
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
