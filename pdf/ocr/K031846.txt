Statement Information supporting claims of substantial equivalence, as
defined under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
respecting safety and effectiveness is summarized below. For the
convenience of the Reviewer, this summary is formatted in
accordance with the Agency’s final rule “.... 510(k) Summaries
and 510(k) Statements ....” (21 CFR 807) and can be used to

MODIFIED DEVICE NAME: CardioVations Optical
Bipolar Device

PREDICATE DEVICE NAME: Clearglide Precision Bipolar
Device

Device Description The CardioVations Optical Bipolar is a sterile, single patient use,
bipolar electrosurgical instrument with features to dissect,
coagulate, and transect tissue with a knife blade. The instrument
will be indicated for endoscopic and open tissue dissection bipolar
coagulation and transection of vessels. For example like the
predicate device, the instrument will be used in vessel harvesting
for side branch management (e.g., dissection, coagulation, cutting).
The working end of the instrument is composed of the inline jaws
for clamping tissue (vessels), the electrode surface for bipolar
coagulation and the knife for vessel transection. A cannula port is
included in the modified device design for endoscope insertion and
a CO) luer connection. The instrument is 50 cm (19.6 inches) in
length, and utilizes bipolar energy from a standard bipolar
electrosurgical generator (ESG).

Intended Use The CardioVations Optical Bipolar Device is intended to be used
for endoscopic and open dissection, bipolar coagulation, and
transection of vessels.

Indications Statement The CardioVations Optical Bipolar Device is indicated for
endoscopic and open dissection, bipolar coagulation, and
transection of vessels.

Dear Mr. Cecchini:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration. :
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may

CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
