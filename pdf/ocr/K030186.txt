This summary of safety and effectiveness information is being submitted in

accordance with the requirements of the SMDA 1990 and 21 CFR 807.92.

Name of the Device: Polaris LV

Predicate Devices: | The Polaris LV is substantially equivalent to a combination of
the following devices: the Polaris DS, manufactured by :
Syneron Medical Ltd. and subject of K024064; the PhotoDerm
Nd:YAG Accessory, manufactured by ESC Medical Ltd., and
subject of K980537; the SLP 1000, manufactured by Palomar
Medical Technologies Inc., and subject of KO13028; the
Dornier Medilas D SkinPulse Laser, manufactured by
DornierMedTech, and subject of K020339.

Device Description: The Polaris LV is a device that is used for treatment of vascular
lesions. The Polaris LV treatment is based on the principle of
selective (electromagnetic) thermolysis. According to this
principle, parameters of optical and RF energy (spectrum,
exposure duration and energy density) are chosen and
optimized to selectively damage vascular lesions without
damaging the surrounding tissues.

The Polaris LV is intended for use in dermatology for treatment of vascular lesions.

Based upon an analysis of the overall performance characteristic for the device,

Syneron Medical Ltd. believes that no significant differences exit. Therefore the

Polaris DS should raise no new issues of safety or effectiveness.

You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of

CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
