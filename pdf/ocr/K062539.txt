Device Description:
The nContact Coagulation System consists of a sterile, single-use, disposable
coagulation electrode device (2cm & 5cm sizes provided) intended to be used
to coagulate soft tissue. The flexible, cooled electrode device, with a suction
stabilizer feature, transmits radiofrequency (RF) energy from an
Electrosurgical Generator (non-sterile, re-useable) connected through an
Instrument Cable (sterile).
intended Use:
The nContact Coagulation System is intended for the coagulation of soft
tissue using radiofrequency (RF) energy.
Non-clinical Performance:
The nContact Coagulation System has been compared to the listed predicate
devices with respect to intended use, technological characteristics, and
principle of operation. Performance testing was completed to validate its
intended use. All of the features specified for the subject device are covered
by those listed in at least one predicate device.
Substantial Equivalence:
The nContact Coagulation System may be considered substantially
equivalent to the predicate devices based on performance and comparative
data, and does not raise new questions of safety and efficacy.

Dear Ms. Ricupero:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
tefcrenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for
use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce
prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good
manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class I] (Special Controls) or class If (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administcred by other Federal agencies. You must comply
with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part
807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the
quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product
radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
