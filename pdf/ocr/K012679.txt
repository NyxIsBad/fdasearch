Trade Name: SterilMed Reprocessed RF Arthroscopy Probes
Classification Name
and Number: Electrosurgical Device, Class II, 21 CFR 878.4400, and
21 CFR 888.1100
Product Code: GE] and HRX
Predicate Device(s): SterilMed’s Reprocessed RF Arthroscopy Probes are
substantially equivalent to the Arthroscopy Probes packaged
with:
e ArthroCare Corp.’s ArthroCare Orthopedic Electrosurgery
System (K992581);
e Oratec Interventions, Inc.’s Vulcan™ EAS™
ElectroThermal Arthroscopy System and Accessories
(K991140);
¢ Mitek®Products Vapr ™ System and Accessory
Electrosurgical Electrodes (K974022) (K992876)
(K002422); and
¢ To their counterparts from the original manufacturers.
Device Description: SterilMed’s reprocessed RF Arthroscopy Probes are radio
frequency electrosurgical devices that are designed for
arthroscopic surgical procedures and are used with a conductive
irrigant. They consist of connector pins, a handle, an insulated
cannula, a return electrode, an electrode tip with single or
multiple electrodes, and come in straight or angled designs.
Intended Use: These devices are designed for general surgical use, including
orthopedic and arthroscopic applications of resection, ablation,
excision of soft tissue, hemostasis of blood vessels, and

coagulation of soft tissue. Arthroscopic surgery may include
the following: Knee, Shoulder, Ankle, Elbow, and Wrist.
Functional and
Safety Testing: Representative samples of reprocessed RF Arthroscopy Probes
underwent bench testing to demonstrate appropriate functional
characteristics. Process validation testing was done to validate
the cleaning and sterilization procedures as well as the devices
packaging. In addition, the manufacturing process includes
visual and functional testing of all products produced.
Conclusion: The RF Arthroscopy Probes reprocessed by SterilMed are
substantially equivalent to the Arthroscopy Probes packaged
with:
e ArthroCare Corp.’s ArthroCare Orthopedic Electrosurgery
System (K992581);
e Oratec Interventions, Inc.’s Vulcan™ EAS™
ElectroThermal Arthroscopy System and Accessories
(K991140);
e ) Mitek® Products Vapr ™ System and Accessory
Electrosurgical Electrodes (K974022) (K992876)
(K002422); and
e To their counterparts from the original manufacturers.
This conclusion is based upon the fact that these devices’ are
essentially identical to their predicate devices in terms of
functional! design, materials, indications for use, and principles
of operation

Dear Mr. Fleischhacker:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications

devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may

CER Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
, product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act), 21 CFR 1000-1050.
