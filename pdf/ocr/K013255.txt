Hewlett. New York 11557
2. Device name and classification:
2.1 Device Name: Surgitron 120 IEC (Also known as Surgitron 4.0 Dual RF)
‘ 2.2 Classification: Class 2 device, 21 CFR 878.4400
3. Description of the device:
The ellman Surgitron 120 IEC enhanced capability Electrosurgery Generator described
herein is a compact source of high power RF energy to be employed for a variety of
radiosurgery procedures. This action is achieved by front panel selection of waveforms
and power level. All selection is effected through push buttons and lamps which give the
operator feedback of status. Power level for each mode is indicated by front panel digital
displays which also show the status of self-test and monitoring. This display is
interlocked with the controls to prevent operation when FAIL is displayed. The final
output power control is made through foot and/or hand switches. Both Monopolar and
Bipolar electrodes are provided. It is designed to comply with international safety
standards.

Dear Mr. Lin:
This letter corrects our substantially equivalent letter of November 7, 2001 regarding the file
number.
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls
provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual
registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against
misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be
found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
ur any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CER Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
