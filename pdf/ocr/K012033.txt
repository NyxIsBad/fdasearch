3. Identification of Predicate or Legaliy Marketed Device
The Multifunction Endoscopic Instrument is substantially equivalent
in intended use and/or function to the following predicate devices:
e f€verest Evershears Bipolar Scissors K 000496, manufactured by Everest
Medical
¢ Circon Tripolar Forceps 510(k) number unknown, believed to be legally
marketed under K884306, manufactured by Circon Corporation

4. Device Description
The Multifunction Endoscopic Instrument is a single patient use device,
which is a combination scissors and bipolar coagulator-grasper. It is
intended for use in canjunctian with presently employed. 5-10mm trocar
cannulae. The instrument grasping and cutting functions are operated
easily using one hand. The device is indicated for use in a variety of open
and minimally invasive procedures. It is designed to facilitate grasping,
mobilization, dissection, coagulation and transection of tissue.

Seedling Enterprises, LLC PreMarket Notification
Multifunction Endoscopic Instrument
The grasping and cutting functions of the distal end are accomplished by
employing three elements.

o Acentral stationary member serves as both a scissors blade and a
forceps jaw.

o Aseparate scissors blade and a forceps jaw are attached to the
stationary member such that they can be independently pivoted to
open and close thereby performing the cutting and grasping
functions.

© The pivoting scissors blade and forceps jaw are connected to the
handle and actuated via linkages.

5. Intended Use

The MEI is a laparoscopic and endoscopic, bipolar, electrosurgical device
intended for grasping, dissecting, coagulating and transecting tissue in
laparoscopic and open procedures.

The types of surgery indicated are:

General surgery

Laparoscopic procedures

Endoscopic procedures

Laryngeal coagulation

Orthopedic coagulation

Thorascopic coagulation

Neurosurgical coagulation

Gynecological coagulation, (except for use in female

sterilization)

Ear, Nose and Throat coagulation

6. Comparison of Technological Characteristics

The Multifunction Endoscopic Instrument is substantially equivalent to the
predicate devices listed, which provide the same or similar functions. All of
the devices are bipolar scissors or graspers that permit the coagulation of
soft tissue through the use of bipolar energy. All of the devices use sharp
objects (scissors or knives) to permit the surgeon to cut the desiccated
tissues. All are connected to the same or similar electrosurgical generators
and use similar power ranges for operation.

Seedling Enterprises, LLC PreMarket Notification
Multifunction Endoscopic Instrument
The technological characteristics are the same as the predicates in that
they are all electrosurgical devices that use bipolar electrical energy to
provide coagulation powered by electrosurgical generators, and provide
cutting with either a knife or a scissors. They are also similar in
construction in that they have a handle, shaft and end effectors (working
end). The working ends of the predicate devices are comprised of grasping
or scissors jaws with the electrode surfaces, and embedded knives or
scissors. The working end of the MEI is comprised of grasper jaws with the
electrode surfaces, and scissor blades.
The intended use, statement of indications and technological and
performance characteristics of the Multifunction Endoscopic Instrument
support the concept of substantial equivalence.
7. Performance Testing
The Multifunction Endoscopic Instrument complies with the following
voluntary standards:
e ANSIAAMI HF 18-1993 Electrosurgical Devices
e {EC 60601-1-2 Medical Electrical Equipment - General Requirements for
Safety

Received: June 29, 2001
Dear Ms. Iampietro:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 53 1-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801 and
additionally 21 CFR Part 809.10 for in vitro diagnostic devices), please contact the Office of
Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Additionally, for questions on the promotion and advertising of
