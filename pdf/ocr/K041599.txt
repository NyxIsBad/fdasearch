Both devices are manufactured by Boston Scientific on the same assembly line in San
Jose of the exact same materials, processes and specifications. Both are EtO sterilized in
processes validated to ISO 11135. Both devices have identical indications for use.
f. Summary of Supporting Data
No data supporting equivalence between the Estech Cobra Adhere Surgical System and
the Boston Scientific Cobra Adhere Surgical System is necessary because both are the
same device.

Dear Mr. Coombs:
This letter corrects our substantially equivalent letter of July 27, 2004.
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device

for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices,
good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA),
it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be
found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may

CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to continue marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your
device to proceed to the market.
