Predicate Device(s)
K051168 HALO Coagulation System-BARRX Medical Inc.
K050831 Stellartech Coagulation System 2-Stellartech Research Corporation
Intended Use / Indications for Use
The HALO Coagulation System intended use is for the coagulation of bleeding and
non-bleeding sites in the gastrointestinal tract.
The HALO Coagulation System is indicated for use in the coagulation of bleeding
and non-bleeding sites in the gastrointestinal tract including but not limited to, the
esophagus. Indications include Esophageal Ulcers, Mallory-Weiss tears,
Arteriovenous Malformations, Angiomata, Barrett’s Esophagus, Dieulafoy Lesions,
and Angiodysplasia.
Technological Characteristics
The HALO Coagulation System consists of the HALO Coagulation Generator
with a disposable single-use HALO” Coagulation Catheter, output cable, and an
optional footswitch. The HALO” Coagulation System performance and mode of
operation is substantially equivalent to the already cleared HALO®® Coagulation
System and Stellartech Coagulation System 2.
Substantial Equivalence
The HALO®% Coagulation System and the predicate devices: HALO% Coagulation
System and Stellartech Coagulation System 2 have the same or similar intended
use, indications for use, technological characteristics, and principles of operation.
The technological differences between the HALO® Coagulation System and its
predicates are: (1) use of an endoscope and pivot mechanism for electrode
positioning; (2) elimination of the sizing balloon and the need to select a custom size
coagulation catheter; (3) additional materials; and (4) minor modification of the
generator software to support the changes in the catheter design. All these
differences were evaluated on bench and did not raise questions regarding safety
and efficacy. Thus the devices are equivalent.

Dear Ms: Filimon:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for
use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce
prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the gencral controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good
manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class I] (Special Controls) or class HI! (Premarket
Approval), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your
device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA
