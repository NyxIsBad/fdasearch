2.1 SUBSTANTIALLY EQUIVALENT
The PASCAL Synthesis Delivery System is substantially equivalent in intended use and
has the same technological characteristics as the delivery system incorporated into
PASCAL Photocoagulator (K043486). The PASCAL Synthesis Delivery System is also
substantially equivalent to the Infinitech Multi-Spot Slit Lamp Laser Adapter (K971950)
by Infinitech, Inc. in functionality and technology in that when this device is connected to
another laser, it enables the user to perform multi-spot laser photocoagulation.
2.2 DESCRIPTION OF THE DEVICE SUBJECT TO PREMARKET NOTIFICATION
The PASCAL Synthesis Delivery System is a scanning laser delivery system that enables
the use of proprietary pattern scanning technology of the PASCAL multi-spot
photocoagulator (a predicate device) with other commercially available laser platforms.
This offers existing commercially available laser platforms the ability to deliver a full
spectrum of pattern scanning options. The PASCAL Synthesis Delivery System is
intended for use by trained ophthalmologists for diagnosis and treatment of ocular
pathology.
The PASCAL Synthesis Delivery System consists of the following system components:

1) Scanning laser delivery system integrated into an Optimedica slit lamp with
LCD/Touchscreen GUI that can be positioned by the user for optimal access
and viewing.

2) Scanner control module with scanner controls, power supply, electronics,
optical fiber & electrical connections integrated into a slit lamp table.

The PASCAL Synthesis Delivery System is compatible with the following commercially
available laser systems:

e Alcon Ophthalas 532 Eyelite Laser Photocoagulator
e Zeiss Visulas 532s

2.3. INDICATION FOR USE
The PASCAL Synthesis Delivery System is a stand alone scanning delivery
system that, when connected to compatible commercially available laser
photocoagulators, allows fully functional scanning Photocoagulation.
When connected to a compatible laser system, the PASCAL Synthesis Delivery
System is indicated for use in the treatment of ocular pathology in both the
posterior and anterior segments, retinal photocoagulation, pan retinal
photocoagulation, focal photocoagulation and grid photocoagulation for vascular
and structural abnormalities of the retina and choroid including:

* Proliferative and nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy

e Macular edema

e Choroidal neovascularization

e Branch and central retinal vein occlusion

e Age-related macular degeneration

e Lattice degeneration

e Retinal tears and detachments

e Iridotomy, iridectomy and trabeculoplasty in angle closure and open angle :

glaucoma.

2.4 CONTRAINDICATIONS
Laser surgery is contraindicated when an appropriate procedure cannot be performed
safely. This occurs when tissue targets cannot be visualized properly. Under such
circumstances, an important tissue structure adjacent to a target tissue might be
photocoagulated inadvertently. Corneal opacities, cataract formation, and vitreous
hemorrhage can all interfere with the laser surgeon’s view of appropriate target
structures. Treatment should be delayed until visualization has adequately improved.
2.5 TECHNICAL CHARACTERISTICS
All user parameters and technological characteristics of the PASCAL Synthesis Delivery
System are consistent with those of the predicate device, the OptiMedica PASCAL
Photocoagulator. Specifically, the PASCAL Synthesis Delivery System is the same
delivery system as the delivery system in the cleared PASCAL Photocoagulator
(K043486). Both delivery systems utilize a scanner to enable faster retinal
photocoagulation. Both devices may operate in an equivalent Single Spot Mode as well
as in a Pattern Mode, where the aim beam is rapidly scanned allowing the physician to
visualize a user-selected pattern of spots at the appropriate location for treatment. Similar
to the second predicate device, the Infinitech Multi-Spot laser adapter, the PASCAL

510(K) SUMMARY OF SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS
Synthesis Delivery System is a stand alone unit that can perform multiple spot
photocoagulation when connected to a compatible external laser system. Both the
PASCAL Synthesis Delivery System and the Infinitech Multi-Spot laser adapter deliver
laser power from the separate 532nm laser system they are connected to. Once activated
by the user, the PASCAL Synthesis Delivery System delivers a predetermined pattern by
sequentially scanning the placement of the laser spots and controlling the emission of the
individual pulses of laser light. Likewise, treatment may be aborted by releasing the
footswitch.
The PASCAL Synthesis Delivery System has been tested and found to be compatible
with the Zeiss Visulas 532s (K013402) and the Alcon Ophthalas 532 Eyelite Laser
Photocoagulator (K962592) laser systems. At this time, no other systems have been
tested for use with the PASCAL Synthesis Delivery System.
2.6 PERFORMANCE DATA
System performance verification testing was completed to verify that measured system
performance complies with specifications and requirements. This was accomplished by
connecting the PASCAL Synthesis Delivery System to the Zeiss Visulas 532s and the
Alcon Ophthalas 532 Eyelite Laser Photocoagulator laser systems and performing
functionality testing to verify that measured system performance complies with defined
system specifications and performance requirements. This testing and evaluation was
performed at OptiMedica’s facility in Santa Clara CA and at outside test facilities as
required.
Extensive system level testing was also completed, including system and software
verification & validation testing, system life testing, system environmental & shipping
testing, EMC/EMI and Electrical safety compliance testing along with system
performance testing. System performance testing included evaluation of power
delivered, pulse widths, scan patterns, spot size & beam uniformity. All test results
demonstrated that performance of the PASCAL Synthesis Delivery System, when
connected to these two commercially-available laser systems, was equivalent to the
performance of the PASCAL Photocoagulator that incorporates the same delivery
system. Verification testing conducted on the PASCAL Synthesis Delivery System also
demonstrated compliance with system performance requirements and specifications; this
testing further confirmed that this device consistently and accurately produces laser
outputs that are equivalent to those produced by the PASCAL Photocoagulator predicate
device.
2.7. BASIS FOR DETERMINATION OF SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE
The indications for use for the PASCAL Synthesis Delivery System are the same as those
cleared for the predicate device, the PASCAL Photocoagulator (K043486). The
materials used for the manufacture of the PASCAL Synthesis Delivery System and the
delivery system of the predicate device, the PASCAL Photocoagulator, are also the same.
Testing of the PASCAL Synthesis Delivery System has demonstrated that it is
functionally equivalent to the predicate device.
