Device Name: Dermablate Effect
Common Name: Dermablate Effect
Classification Name: Instrument, surgical, powered, laser
79-GEX
21 CFR 878.481
Equivalent Devices: MCL 30 Dermablate

Device Description: The Dermablate Effect is a pulsed Er:YAG laser emitting a
wavelength of 2940 nm, that can optionally be equipped
with a pulsed light module (APL) and an acoustic wave
module (AW).
Page 1 of 3

Intended Use: The Dermablate Effect Er:YAG laser with handpiece of larger
spot sizes is intended for use for coagulation, vaporization,
ablation or cutting of soft tissue (skin) in dermatology,
plastic surgery, oral surgery and ophthalmology (skin
around the eyes). .
The Dermablate Effect Er:YAG laser with fractional
handpiece is intended for dermatological and skin
resurfacing procedures.

The Dermablate Effect can be equipped optionally with the
following modules: Asclepion Pulsed Light (APL) and
Acoustic Wave (AW).

The Asclepion Pulsed Light is intended for permanent hair
reduction, treatment of vascular and pigmented lesions and
inflammatory acne.

The Acoustic Wave is intended for the activation of
connective tissue.

Comparison to: The Dermablate Effect is substantially equivalent to the
MCL 30 Dermablate (with regard to the Er:YAG laser
module with handpiece of larger spotsizes), to the Lux2940
Erbium Fractional Handpiece and the Profile ProFractional
Handpiece (with regard to the Er:YAG laser module with
fractional handpiece) to the Photosilk Plus (with regard to
the APL module) and to the class 1 products Cellactor C1
and D-Actor 200 (with regard to the AW module) with the
same principles of operation, and the same indications for
use.

Nonclinical Performance Data: None

Clinical Performance Data: Fractional Er:YAG histological report of Prof. D. Cassuto

Conclusion: The Dermablate Effect is another safe and effective device
for coagulation, vaporization, ablation, cutting of soft tissue,
for fractional dermatological and skin resurfacing

procedures, for permanent hair reduction, the treatment of
vascular and pigmented lesions and inflammatory acne and
for the activation of connective tissue.
