Description | BWF-5 Solid-State Medical Laser Series are highly reliable, compact and
easy to operate medical laser systems. The cutting edge control technology
provides user a high reliable and maintenance free system. The laser light
delivery system consists of a flexible optical fiber threaded through a
lightweight hand piece. Activation occurs when the operator enables the
laser and presses the foot switch. Release the foot switch to deactivate the
laser. Depending on laser system configuration, the foot switch can
function as on/off switch. A convenient and easy-to-use touch-screen
display panel allows the operator to adjust or set laser output level with
minimal effort. The laser can operate in continuous wave mode or
controlled pulse mode. The device features multiple user-programmable
presets for storing frequently used treatment parameters.

Intended Use | The BWF-5 Medical Laser Series are intended for delivery of laser light to
soft tissue in the contact or non-contact mode during surgical procedures,
including via endoscopes, introducers, or catheters. The BWF-5 Medical
Laser Series are generally indicated for incision, excision, vaporization,
ablation, hemostasis or coagulation of soft tissue in ear, nose and throat
and oral surgery (otolaryngology), dental procedures, arthroscopy,
gastroenterology, general surgery, dermatology, plastic surgery, podiatry,
urology, gynecology, neurosurgery (peripheral nervous system),
pulmonary surgery and thoracic surgery.

The Summary of Safety and Effectiveness on the B&W Tek, Inc. BWE-5 Medical Laser Series
reflects data available and represented at the time the submission was prepared, but caution should
be exercised in interpreting the data. The results of future studies and or tests may require
alterations of the conclusions or recommendations set forth.

Warning | e NEVER look directly into the distal end of the optical fiber connected
to an active laser device, direct the laser light directly into the eyes, or
direct the laser beam at anything other than the area to be treated
WITH or WITHOUT the appropriate laser-emission protective
eyewear. Indirect or direct eye contact with the output beam or at
scattered laser light from any reflective surfaces from the laser will
cause serious damage, irreparable corneal and/or retinal damage, and
possible blindness to one or both eyes.

e DONOT allow any reflective object to fall into or obstruct the path of
the laser energy produced by this device. Scattered or reflected laser
energy can cause serious damage to eyes and skin. The operator, all

: assistants, and the patient must remove all reflective objects (such as
rings, metal watchbands, and jewelry) prior to treatment with this
device. Indirect or direct eye contact with the output beam or at
scattered laser light from any reflective surfaces from the laser will
cause serious damage, irreparable corneal and/or retinal damage, and
possible blindness to one or both eyes.

¢ DONOT remove protective eyewear until the operator returns the
laser device to Standby mode.

e¢ DONOT use the System Controls or performance of procedures other
than those specified in this manual may result in hazardous radiation
exposure.

* DONOT attempt to gain access to any internal device component.
THERE ARE NO USER-SERVICEABLE COMPONENTS inside
this laser device. Doing so may cause serious and/or irreversible
injury.

e AVOID THE USE of flammable solvents, anesthetics, oxidizing gases
such as nitrous oxide (N20) and oxygen or endogenous gases. The
high temperatures produced in normal use of the laser equipment may
ignite some material, for example cotton or wool, when saturated with
oxygen. The solvents of adhesives and flammable solutions used for
cleaning and disinfecting should be allowed to evaporate before the

laser equipment is used.

« FAILURE TO COMPLY with all safety instructions and warnings
may expose all participants to harmful levels of laser radiation and/or
dangerous levels of electrical current.

Cautions: | « Never allow untrained personnel to operate this advice unless directly

supervised by a properly trained and experienced individual

e The protective eyewear supplied with this device has an optical
density rating >5 in the 350nm~2000nm (see specification sheet)
region. All personnel present during device operation must ware this
eyewear. Contact B&W Tek at 302-368-7824 to purchase additional
sets of protective eyewear for this device.

Caution | ¢ Select a secure, properly equipped, and well-ventilated location in
continued which to install and operate the laser.

e Place “Laser in use” signs at location entrances where people will use
the B&W Tek, Inc. laser device.

e Always put the laser in Standby mode or switch the device off prior to
adjusting or preparing the hand or piece or fiber optic.

e Never leave this device in the READY mode unattended. See the
STANDBY to READY Mode in the Operations section of this
manual.

e Remove the key from the device’s key switch when not in use to
prevent unauthorized and/or unqualified use of the device as well as
inadvertent laser emissions.

¢ Turn the device off before relocating equipment in the same vicinity.

e Never press the foot switch without first verifying the safe orientation
and proper positioning of the hand piece and distal end of the optical
fiber and ensuring compliance to all safety precautions.

e During any laser procedure, do not allow any nonessential personnel
into the treatment area.

e Never allow the untrained personnel to operate this device unless
directly supervised by a properly trained and experienced individual.

¢ ALWAYS clean the SMA fiber tip before inserting into the SMA
emission port. A dirty tip could result in damage to the unit.

Dear Dr. Wang:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for
use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce
prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good
manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class IH! (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply
with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part
807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the
quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product
radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
