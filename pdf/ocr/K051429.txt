1. Device Name XL oslg QI
ee

Trade Name: CLARIS NON-STICK Bipolar Forceps

Common Name: Bipolar Forceps

2. Classification
[Devices Device, Electrosurgical, Cutting & Coagulation & Accessories

Device description: Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation device and accesso
Medical Specialty: Part 878, General & Plastic Surgery

Regulation Number: | 878.4400

_ 3. Substantial Equivalence

CLARIS NON-STICK Bipolar Forceps are substantially equivalent to other legally marketed Bipolar Forceps from different manufacturers, e.g. Link Technology, Inc. / Silverglide Surgical Technologies, K992931.

4. Description of the Device

During the coagulation of tissue the coagulated tissue might stick to the tip of the forceps. This
undesirable effect can almost completely be avoided by using the new CLARIS NON-STICK bipolar forceps. By applying a material with excellent thermal properties for the tips of the forceps,

. difficult and time-consuming cleaning of the forceps during an operation is no longer necessary
and enables non-stop working. The non-stick effect is permanently ensured and will not be reduced, even if subject to frequent sterilization. By using a suitable connecting cable, CLARIS
NON-STICK bipolar forceps can be connected to all high-frequency electrosurgical generators
generally used.

5. Intended Use

The Bissinger CLARIS NON-STICK bipolar forceps are designed to grasp, manipulate and
coagulate selected tissue. It is to be connected through a suitable bipolar cable with the bipolar
output of an electrosurgical generator. Bipolar Forceps must only be used with bipolar coagulation
current.

The Bissinger CLARIS NON-STICK bipolar forceps has not been shown to be effective for tubal
sterilization or tubal coagulation for sterilization procedures and should not be used for these procedures.

6. Performance Standards

DIN EN 60601-1: Medical electrical equipment - Part 1: General requirements for safety (IEC
60601-1:1988 + A1:1991 + A2:1995); German version EN 60601-1:1990 + A1:1993 + A2:1995;

7. Sterilization by User
BiTech Bipolar Scissors are delivered in non-sterile conditions. The user may sterilize these devices by using a validated and applicable sterilization process.
Cleaning and Maintenance
Every surgical instrument should be disinfected and thoroughly cleaned after each use. Proper
cleaning, inspection and maintenance will help ensure correct function of the surgical instrument.
Clean, inspect and test each instrument carefully. Sterilise all instruments before surgery. A good
cleaning and maintenance procedure will extend the useful life of the instrument.
Special attention must be paid to slots, stops, ends, hollow tubes and other highly inaccessible
areas. Check insulation, cables and connectors for cuts, voids, cracks, tears, abrasions, etc.
Do not use damaged instruments.
Cleaning and rinsing must take place immediately after each use for best effect. Failure to clean
promptly may result in adherent particles or dried secretions that may resist cleaning and complicate or resist future sterilisation.
Instruments must be completely cleaned and rinsed of all foreign matter.

- Use warm water and a commercially available instrument pre-soak or cleaning agent. Enzymatic
cleaners (such as Enzol™) must be used to remove protein deposits. Follow the enzymatic
cleaner’s instructions; rinse thoroughly.
¢ Do not use corrosive cleaning agents (i.e. bleach). Cleaning solutions and rinses at or near a

neutral pH (7.0) are best.
* Do not use abrasive cleaners.
Only a soft bristle brush should be used.
e Immerse the entire device in detergent and clean while soaking.
Rinse with sterile deionized water.
Can be disinfected in the washing machine up to 203°F (95°C).
« Rinse thoroughly with distilled water.
* Prepare for storage and/or sterilisation.
_ Sterilization
Only a validated steam-sterilization process according DIN EN 554 / ISO 11134 that uses a sterilization cycle of 137°C / 280°F, 3 bar, for min. 15 minutes has to be used.
(Note: Contact the manufacturer of your steam autoclave to confirm appropriate temperatures and
sterilisation times.)
Caution: Autoclave temperatures should not exceed 280°F (4 37°C); handles, insulation or other
non-metallic parts may be damaged
Do not sterilise with hot air.
Do not use ‘Flash’ autoclave procedures.
8. Conclusion
Based on the available 510(k) summaries and 510(k) statements (21 CFR 807) and the information provided herein, we conclude that Bissinger CLARIS NON-STICK bipolar forceps are substantially equivalent to the existing legally marketed devices under Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.
