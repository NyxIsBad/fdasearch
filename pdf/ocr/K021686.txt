5100K) SUMMARY
Page -2- / -2All three devices are intended to be used as a fiber optic delivery system for
ND:Yag laser systems. In addition, both the Laser Fiber GF500 and the predicate
device Laser Fiber GF 100 are designed for use in conjunction with the W.O.M.
Laser U100 during lithotripsy procedures in the contact mode. Finally, both the
proposed device and the InnovaQuartz General Shape Laser Fiber are approved
for reuse.
The differences between the Laser Faser GF500 and predicate devices are minor
and raise no new questions of safety and effectiveness. Accordingly, W.O.M.
WORLD OF MEDICINE AG believes that the Laser Fiber GF500 is substantially
equivalent to the predicate devices currently on the market.
VIUL. Performance Data:
The device has been tested in accordance with the European Standard EN 554 and
EN 1174. The Laser Fiber GF500 bears the CE mark in accordance with the
Medical Device Directive 93/42/EEC,

Dear Ms. Raab:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
