Technological Characteristics
The Ceralas D810 Diode Laser and the predicate devices operate with a

power range of 1-60W in the CW or pulsed mode. The Ceralas D180 contains an
ELVeS kit for gaining access to the vasculature to treat varicose veins and
varicosities associated with superficial reflux of the greater saphenous vein.
Substantial Equivalence

The Ceralas D810 with ELVeS has the exact same intended use and
indications for use as its predicate devices, the cleared Diomed 810 laser, the
Ceralas D810, and the Ceralas D980. The Ceralas D810’s proposed varicose vein
indication, which is a modification to its cleared superficial vein reflux indication, is
exactly the same as the Diomed 810’s varicose vein indication. The laser component
of the Ceralas D810 with ELVeS kit is identical to the cleared Ceralas D810 laser,
and its ELVeS kit is identical to the Ceralas D 980’s cleared ELVeS kit. Moreover,
each component of the Ceralas D810’s and Ceralas D980’s ELVeS kit is a cleared
device, a preamendment device, or a 510(k) exempt device for the same general
intended use. Any minor technical differences between the Ceralas D980 and the
Ceralas D810 do not raise the question of safety or effectiveness. Thus, the Ceralas
D810’s cleared with ELVeS kit is substantially equivalent to a combination of its
predicate devices.

Dear Dr. Morello:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration. ,
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Additionally, for questions on the
