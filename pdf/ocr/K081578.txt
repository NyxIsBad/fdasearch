Legally Marketed

Predicate Device: The Accela System is substantially equivalent in terms of
technological characteristics, performance, intended use,
indications for use and operator interface to;

e Chromogenex (K053324)
* Sciton (K032460)
e Lumenis (K020839)

System Description: The Accela is an Intense Pulsed Light-based medical device
utilizing xenon flash lamp technology to iiluminate the dermis to
offer light based therapies as listed in the indications of use. The
Accela emits *light at 400nm to 1200nm via a 50mm x 50mm
treatment area at a repetition rate equal to or less than 0.5Hz
(operator selective).

*Light is delivered to the skin surface, while cold air integrated
through the handpiece, is provided to cool the epidermis.

Performance The device complies with the European Medical Directive

Standards: 93/42/EEC concerning medical devices, and will comply with
voluntary standards UL60601-1:1996 when marketed in the U.S.

Indications for use: Indications for Use for Fitzpatrick skin types (1 to Vi)

e The removal of unwanted hair and to effect stable long-term or *permanent hair
reduction.
*Permanent hair reduction is defined as a long-term stable reduction in the
number of hairs re-growing after a treatment regimen.

« The treatment of moderate inflammatory acne vulgaris

e The treatment of benign pigmented epidermal lesions including dyschromia, ,
hyperpigmentation, melasma, ephelides (freckles)

: e The treatment of cutaneous lesions including warts, scars, and striae. :

e The treatment of benign cutaneous vascular lesions, including port wine stains,
hemangiomas, facial, truncal and leg telangiectasias, erythema of rosacea, angiomas,
and spider angiomas, poikiloderma of civatte, leg veins and venous malformations.

The integrated thermal cooling is indicated for use in cooling the epidermis at the treatment

site prior to, during, and after light or laser treatment in general aesthetic dermatologic and

plastic surgery procedures.

e Reduce pain during and/or with light or laser treatment (via partial anesthesia from

cooling)

e Reduce discomfort during and/or associated with light or laser treatment

e Minimize thermal injury, including thermal necrosis, to non-target skin and skin

structures during and/or associated with light or laser treatment, thus reducing
possible complications such as scabbing, scarring, hyper — and/or hypapigmentation

e Allow the use of higher light or laser fluences for light or laser treatments (such as for

hair removal and the treatment of vascular or pigmented lesions)

e Reduce potential side effects of light or laser treatments (such as for hair removal and

the treatment of vascular or pigmented lesions)

Conclusion: The Accela system is substantially equivalent to its predicate devices cited
above, based on predicate similarities. Despite the differences, the skin is
treated in the same manner as the preidicate devices, Intense Pulsed Light
and dermal cooling.

: Side Effects: In extreme cases, effects from treatment can include excessively red
patches in the shape of the applicator head and blistering. If this occurs
the tissue should be cooled and cared for as would normally be the case
with burns to the skin, i.e. do not burst any blister formation, keep clean
and covered until healed. if blisters form, they are usually intra-epidermal in nature and heal without
scarring. Inappropriate management of blisters during the healing stage
will increase the chance of scarring.

Dear Mr. Conry:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
teferenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class I] (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act), 21 CFR 1000-1050.
