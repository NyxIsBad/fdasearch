Device Description: The Medtronic Cardioblate® 68000 Generator is a reusable, non
sterile radiofrequency generator. In bipolar mode, the generator is
attached to a bipolar Surgical Ablation Device (e.g. Model 60831
or 60841), which is the hand-held, sterile, single-use device that
applies radiofrequency energy to the selected tissue.
The Cardioblate® 68000 Generator is capable of delivering a
controlied amount of radiofrequency energy for both Monopolar
and Bipolar surgical ablation techniques. The generator delivers
up to 50 Watts energy in either the bipolar or monopolar mode.

Intended Use: The Cardioblate® Surgical Ablation System is intended to ablate
soft tissue during general surgery using radiofrequency energy.

Contraindications: | The Cardioblate® Surgical Ablation System is contraindicated for
patients that have active endocarditis at the time of surgery.

Comparison to

Predicate Device: The Cardioblate® Surgical Ablation System with the model 68000
Generator is substantially equivalent to the Cardioblate® Surgical
Ablation System with the Model 60890 Generator cleared by
K031247. The Generator uses the same energy source to deliver
the same amount of radiofrequency energy to ablate tissues, and
uses the same surgical ablation devices. Although both generators
use the same algorithms to operate, the Model 68000 Generator is
updated to include a touchscreen interface, an updated
microprocessor and a molded, ergonomic case.

Test Data: Verification and validation testing confirms that the functional
characteristics of the Cardioblate Surgical Ablation System with
the Cardioblate® 68000 Generator are substantially equivalent to
the predicate devices cited. This included software validation,
hardware qualification, electromagnetic compatibility and safety
testing on the generator, and lesion equivalence and transmurality
equivalence tests on tissue with the entire system.

Summary: Based on the technical information, intended use, laboratory
verification tests and in vitro performance information provided,
the system which includes the Cardioblate® 68000 in substantially
equivalent to the currently marketed predicate device.

Dear Ms. Ankova:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class I] (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA).
it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device
can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition. PDA
may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing Q)
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act): 21 CFR 1000-1050.
