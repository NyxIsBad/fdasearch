6. Rationale for Substantial Equivalence
The Revolix laser system with fiber optic delivery devices share the same intended use,
indications for use, similar design features and functional features and therefore are
substantially equivalent to the Lumenis VersaPulse PowerSuite 100 watt Holmium Laser,
the Trimedyne OmniMax 80 watt Holmium Laser and the Laserscope Green Laser
7. Conclusion
The Revolix Laser System with fiber optic delivery devices were found to be substantially
equivalent to similar currently marketed and predicate surgical laser systems and
delivery devices.
