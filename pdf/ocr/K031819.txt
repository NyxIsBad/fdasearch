Performance Standards: The Dio-Dent 10 Diode Laser complies with:

U.S. Federal Performance Standards 21 CFR 1040.10 and 21 CFR
1040.11 for class [V Laser Products.

In addition, the device complies with the European Medical
Directive 93/42/EEC concerning medical devices (Annex ID and
with the voluntary standards IEC 60601-1, IEC 60601-1-2, IEC60825-1 and IEC 601-2-22.

Intended Use / Indication for Use: The Dio-Dent 10 Dental Diode Laser System is
intended for incision, excision, ablation, vaporization and/or
coagulation (hemostasis) of oral soft tissue (including marginal and
interdental gingiva and epithelial lining of free gingiva). In
addition, the system is intended for teeth whitening.

The Indications for Use of the Dio-Dent 10 Dental Diode Laser
System include:
Cosmetic Dentistry
* Light activation for bieaching materials for teeth whitening
* Laser-assisted bleaching/whitening of the teeth
Endodontology
* Pulpotomy
« Pulpotomy as an adjunct to root canal therapy
Periodontology
¢ Sulcular debridement (removal of diseased or inflamed soft
tissue in the periodental pocket)
Oral Soft Tissue Surgery
* Biopsy
* Operculectomy
* Gingivectomy
* Gingivoplasty
* Oral papillectomy
* Leukoplakia
* Treatment of aphthous ulcers
* Fibroma removal
¢ Frenectomy
* Frenotomy
¢ Tissue retraction for impressions
* Incising and draining of abscesses
¢ Draining fistulas
« Exposure of unerupted partially erupted teeth
* Lesion (tumor) removal
¢ Implant recovery

¢ Implant uncovering

* Gingival troughing

* Crown lengthening

* Hemostasis of donor site

* Coagulation and decontamination of extraction sites

* Removal of granulation tissue

* Degranulation of infrabony defects

¢ Laser assisted flap surgery

* Vestibuloplasty

* Removal of hyperplastic tissues

* Debridement of diseased epithelial lining

Device Description: The Dio-Dent 10 Dental Diode Laser is designed to perform several
medical procedures in the oral soft tissue and to perform laser
assisted aesthetic tooth whitening procedures.

: A Gallium Aluminum Arsenide (GaAlAs) solid state laser diode
provides optical energy to oral soft tissues.

A fiber optic held by a handpiece delivers up to 10Watts laser

energy. A visible light emitted from the handpiece’s distal end

targets the area of treatment. The optical power output and pulse
may be adjusted to specific use requirements.

Substantial Equivalence: There are no unique applications, indications, material or
specifications presented below. Evidence of equivalence has been
demonstrated through:

* The Dio-Dent 10 intended use and indications for use were
previously cleared by FDA for the predicate devices.

* The technical characteristics of the Dio-Dent 10 are similar to
those of the cleared Ceralas™ and Opus 10™.

* Laser output values of the Dio-Dent 10 are well within previous
cleared values of the predicate dental diode laser systems as
described.

* The predicate devices and other previous cleared lasers with
similar energy output have a proven safety and effectiveness in
the treatment of the claimed indications.

* Satety and performance testing.

Therefore. the Dio-Dent 10 Dental Diode Laser System is

substantially equivalent to its predicate devices cited above and

raises no new safety and/or effectiveness issues.

Dear Mr. Hacohen:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class 1] (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820): and if applicable. the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act): 21 CFR 1000-1050.
