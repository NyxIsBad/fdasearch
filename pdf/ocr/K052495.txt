Date of Summary: August 23, 2005 Classification Name: Laser Instrument.
Surgical Powered
Common Name: Surgical Laser Instrument Proprietary — Atrilaze™ Mallcable
S-2 Disposable Probe
Description of Device: The Altrilaze Mallcable S-2 Disposable Probe is used with the
Atrilaze'™ Surgical Ablation System which consists of a generator designed for the delivery of
810nm laser light and a hand held fiber optic light delivery device (probe) fitted with a standard
SMA 905 connector at the proximal end. The system may be used in conjunction with surgical
treatment for hemostasis, incision, ablation, coagulation and vaporization of tissuc as required by
the clinician
Statement of Intended Use: The stated intended use of the Atrilaze Mallcable S-2 Disposable
Probe is the same as the MedicalCV Atrilaze™ Surgical Ablation System. It is indicated for the
delivery of 810nm laser light to soft tissuc to include cardiac tissue, during surgical procedures.
Indications include the incision. excision, dissection, vaporization, ablation or coagulation of soft
tissuc.
Warning: The Atrilaze Ablation System is not indicated for the treatment of cardiac
arrhythmias
The risk of actual damage to adjacent organs from the instrument exists and
perforation, rupture or tearing of tissue, may occur as a complication of laser use
Bums can occur if the laser energy is not correctly applied. These complications
mav be sertous

Technological Comparison: The Atrilazc Malleable S-2 Disposable Probe is the same as that
of the existing Non-Malleable Disposible Probe that was granted market clearance under
K040744. The fiber optic delivery system (probe) is coupled to the laser via an SMA 905
connector to deliver laser radiation to the target tissue(s). For purposes of this submission, the
Atrilaze Malleable S-2 Disposable Probe was compared to the following predicate device(s):
* MedicalCV, Inc. Non-Malleable Disposable Probe (K040744)
¢ CardioFocus, Inc. Malleable Surgical Lightstic 180 (K013901)
Testing: Results of biocompatibility testing support statement that the material change
from stainless stecl to nitinol had no impact on previously gathered test results (K040744). The
probe is non-toxic, non-hemolytic, and non-pyrogenic. All biocompatibility testing was
conducted under Good Laboratory Practices per 21 CFR Part 58
Performance testing for the Atrilazc Malleable S-2 Disposable Probe included
compliance to manufacturing specifications for Power Output, Tip Pull-Off. Pressure and Flow
for the fiber optic light delivery device. Testing demonstrated that the Altrilaze Malleable $-2
Disposable Probe is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.

Dear Mr. Steger:
This letter corrects our substantially equivalent letter of October 11, 2005.
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices,
good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA),
it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be
found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to continue marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your
device to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0120. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
