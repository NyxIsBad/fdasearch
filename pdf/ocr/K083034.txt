DEVICE DESCRIPTION
The Fotona XD Diode Laser System is based on a semiconductor laser that operates in.the near. infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum. The laser source consists of a compact
: semiconductor laser diode module that emits laser light at a wavelength of 810 nm in continuous
wave mode or pulse operation mode from 20 Hz to 10 kHz. The output power can be set from 250 /
mW to 7.0W. A red diode aiming beam (650 nm) is combined with the therapeutic laser beam and ,
. both beams are guided through an optical fiber delivery unit and an optical handpiece to the .
: (veaiment site. , : :

STATEMENT OF SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE
The Fotona XD Diode Laser System shares the same indications for use, similar design and
functional features with, and therefore Fotona d.d. believes that its Fotona XD Laser System is
substantially equivalent to, the
‘ a) Odyssey 2.4G Diode Laser (K050453) previously cleared for a variety of surgical procedures on
. soft tissue within the oral cavity;
b) Opus 10 Dental Diode Laser System (With Tooth Whitening Application) (K011769) previously
/ cleared for incision, excision, ablation, vaporization and/or coagulation (hemostasis) of oral soft
tissue (including marginal and interdental gingiva and epithelial lining of free gingiva). In addition,
the system is intended for teeth whitening. /
Details are provided in the Substantial Equivalence Discussion Section of this submission.
