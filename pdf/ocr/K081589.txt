DEVICE DESCRIPTION:
The Waterlase®3.0 hydrokinctic dental laser system is a diverse device utilized to perform a variety of
dental applications. For hard tissue procedures the Waterlase®3.0 uses the Erbium,
Chromium:Yttrium, Scandium, Gallium Garnet (Er,Cr:Y¥YSGG) laser in combination with advanced
water atomization spray technology to cut, remove, roughen and etch tissues. Soft tissue procedures
are performed using a different mode of operation where direct Er,Cr:YSGG laser energy is applied to
incise, excise or ablate these tissues. In soft tissue procedures the water spray is applied for hydration,
cooling or to keep tissues clean. For hard tissue applications the spray is part of the tissue removing
process as well as hydration, cooling and keeping tissues clean.
A flexible fiberoptic handpiece delivers the Waterlase®3.0 laser energy. A visible light emitted from
the handpiece distal end pinpoints the area of treatment. In both hard and soft tissue applications the

CONTRAINDICATIONS:
All clinical procedures performed with the Waterlase®3.0 must be subject to the same clinical
judgment and care as with traditional techniques. Patient risk must always be considered and fully
understood before clinical treatment. The clinician must completely understand the patient’s medical
history prior to treatment. Exercise caution for general medical conditions, which might contraindicate
a local procedure. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to, allergy to local or topical
anesthetics, heart disease, lung disease, bleeding disorders, sleep apnea or an immune system
deficiency. Medical clearance from the patient’s physician is advisable when doubt exists regarding
treatment.
Conclusion:
The indications included herein are the same as indications that have been previously cleared by the
FDA for the predicate device. Substantial equivalency for the Waterlase®3.0 has been determined
through comparison to a previously cleared device.

Dear Ms. Rizoiu:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class I] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
