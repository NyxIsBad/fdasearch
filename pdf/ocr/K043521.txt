Date Summary Prepared: September 30, 2004

Device Trade Name: BIOS YAG 50 Med

Common Name: Medical Laser System

Classification Name: Instrument, surgical, powered, laser
79 - GEX
21 CFR 878.4810

Equivalent Device: Cynosure Smartepil (K020107)

Device Description: The BIOSYAG 50 Med laser is a pulse Nd: YAG laser
utilizing the Nd:YAG crystal as the lasing medium. It is a
pulsed laser with wavelength of 1064 nm.

Within the system an optical cavity contains the Nd:YAG

crystal which is activated by means of the use of flash

lamps. After the cavity a red diode aiming beam is reflected
onto a coaxial beam path using a beamsplitter assembly.
The combined therapeutic and aiming beam are guided
down an optical fiber delivery system to a focusing
handpiece. The laser is used in non-contact mode.
The BIOSYAG 50 Med laser is composed by 5 major
subsystems:

a) A high voltage power supply which converts and
rectifies the a.c. main current to provide regulate power
for the flashlamp simmer current and main triggering
pulse.

b) A cooling system consisting of an internal water flow
circuit with water-to-air hath exchanger.

c) An optical delivery system, interfacing the energy from
the laser to patient via an optical fiber and focusing
handpiece.

d) A microprocessor based controller which regulates the
functions of the laser and allows parameter selection by
the user.

Intended Use: The BIOS YAG 50 Med laser is indicated for benign
vascular lesions and hair removal.
Rationale for Substantial The product specification, functionality, indication for use,
Equivalence: and treatment parameters of the The BIOSYAG 50 Med
laser are the same or very similar to the legally
marketed laser Cynosure Smartepil.

Both equipments have the same indication for use.

Both system comprise a flashlamp pumped laser rod

(Nd:YAG) generating light at a wavelength of 1064 nm,

which is subsequently delivered to the patient via an optical

fiber delivery system and focusing handpiece.

BIOSYAG 50 Med output characteristics (including pulse

duration and fluence) are identical, or very similar, to those

of predicate device.

Both lasers utilize class IIA aiming beam.

Both lasers are microprocessor controlled devices.

Both systems utilize an internal closed loop water-air heath

exchanger circuit for optimal thermal control of laser cavity
The risk and benefits for the BIOSYAG 50 Med are
comparable to the predicate device, it is therefore believed
that there are no new questions of Safety and Effectiveness
raised by the introduction of this device.

Dear Mr. Franchi:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
"devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug.
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class HI (PMA). it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition. FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with ail the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (2!
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as sel
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable. the electronic
product radiation contro! provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 - Mr. Allessandro Franchi
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled.
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
