Product Description
The Visage Wands are bipolar, high frequency electrosurgical devices designed for
general dermatological, cosmetic, plastic, and reconstructive procedures.
Intended Use
The Visage Wands are indicated for resection, ablation, and coagulation of soft tissue and
hemostasis of blood vessels in general dermatology, cosmetic, plastic, and reconstructive
surgery including:

=  Abscesses = Oculoplastic Procedures

= Aponeurotic Repair = Panniculectomy

Substantial Equivalence
In establishing substantial equivalence to the predicate devices, ArthroCare evaluated the
indications for use, materials incorporated, product specifications, and energy
requirements of those systems. Additionally, performance testing has been completed to
demonstrate the safe and effective use of the Visage Wands in the resection, ablation, and
coagulation of soft tissue, and hemostasis of blood vessels. The expansion of the
indications to include specific general dermatological, cosmetic, plastic, and
reconstructive procedures does not raise any new issues of safety or efficacy.

Dear Mr. Prothro:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for
use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce

have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good
manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it

807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the
