Device Information:
Classification: Class I
Trade Name: Rubicor EnCapsule™ Breast Biopsy Device :
Classification Name: Electrosurgical Device and accessories (21 CFR
870.4400)
Equivalent Device:
The subject device and accessory are substantially equivalent in intended use and/or
method of operation to the Rubicor EnCapsule™ Breast Biopsy Device (K023601)
Intended Use:
The Rubicor EnCapsule™ Breast Biopsy Device is intended for diagnostic sampling of
breast tissue during breast biopsy procedures. It is to be used for diagnostic purposes only
and is not intended for therapeutic uses.
The Rubicor EnCapsule™ Breast Biopsy Device is indicated to provide breast tissue
samples for diagnostic sampling of breast abnormialities. It is designed to provide breast
tissue for histologic examination with a partial or complete removal of the imaged
abnormality.
The extent of histological abnormality cannot be reliably determined from its
mammographic appearance. Therefore, the extent of removal of the imaged evidence of
an abnormality does not predict the extent of removal of a histologic abnormality (e.g.
malignancy). When the sampled abnormality is not histologically benign, it is essential
that the tissue margins be examined for completeness of removal using standard surgical
procedures.
