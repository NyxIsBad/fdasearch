Indication For Use Statement
The AtriCure Bipolar Coagulation System is intended to ablate and coagulate soft tissue during
General, ENT, Thoracic, Gynecology, and Urology surgical procedures.
Product Description
The system is comprised of the Bipolar Handpiece (single patient use) with integral cable and the
re-usable Ablation and Sensing Unit (ASU).
The ASU is a portable reusable device that produces and delivers RF bipolar energy near the AM
frequency band:to coagulate and ablate biological tissue. The device consists of a RF PCB
(printed circuit board), microprocessor PCB, measurement PCB, display PCB, AC power supply,
power entry module, volume control, footswitch Interface, and Handpiece interface. Front panel
indicators include an LED temperature display, a LCD graphics conductance display, and LED
lamps indicating power on, fault condition, ready state, RF on, and conductance state. The ASU
limits the amount of voltage, current and time at which power is output to the Handpiece. Upon
reaching a threshold conductance, the ASU will light a visual indicator and sound an audible tone
signaling that the conditions for a complete ablation have been satisfied. A footswitch is included
in the Ablation System to activate RF energy delivery.

The system delivers Bipolar RF energy to tissue that is clamped between the Handpiece jaws.
Pressing of the footswitch initiates the RF energy output. RF energy output is terminated by
releasing the footswitch or upon expiration of the RF backup timer.
The Handpiece connects to the ASU and utilizes Bipolar RF energy to ablate tissue that is
clamped between the instrument jaws. The Handpiece includes a set of jaws that are capable of
grasping tissue up to 10mm in thickness. Each jaw is comprised of an electrode with surrounding
insulators and imbedded temperature-sensing element allowing for the transfer of energy to
tissue and the monitoring of temperature rise by the tissue. The handle includes a lever that :
applies a controlled force to the tissue in the jaws. At a predetermined force the jaws latch. A
trigger is provided to release the latch at the end of the ablation.
The AtriCure Bipolar System meets the following performance industriai/international standards.

Dear Dr. Friedman: : . |
|
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device |
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market. :
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801 and
additionally 21 CFR Part 809.10 for in vitro diagnostic devices), please contact the Office of
Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Additionally, for questions on the promotion and advertising of
your device, please contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4639. Also, please note the
regulation entitled, “Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). :
Other general information on your responsibilities under the Act may be obtained from the
