New Device Name Trade Name: Ethicon Endo Surgery® Articulating Needle Knife
Common or Usual Name: Electrosurgical Needle Electrodes
Classification Name: Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation device
and accessories (21 CFR 878.4400, Product Code GEI)
Predicate Devices. KSEA Monopolar Coagulating Needle Electrode (K972497)
Colorado MicroDissection Needle (K000348)
Boston Scientific RX Needle Knife (K970053)
Device Description The Ethicon Endo Surgery® (EES) Articulating Needle Knife is an
endoscopic instrument intended for cutting, dissecting and cauterizing tissue via highfrequency electrical current waveform. The device consists of a flexible wire cable and
needle knife electrode, which can be extended, rotated, articulated, and retracted from the
flexible outer shaft using a three-finger actuator. When connected to an electrosurgical
generator and activated, the Necdle Knife delivers a monopolar electrical current to the
surgical site. This device passes through endoscopes having a 3.2 mm or larger working
channels. This device is supplied sterile for single-patient use.
Indications for Use The Articulating Needle Knife is a monopolar electrosurgical
instrument intended for cutting, dissecting and cauterizing soft tissue during endoscopic
electrosurgical procedures. The Articulating Needle Knife is not intended for use in the
central nervous system or in the central circulatory system.
Technological Characteristics The EES device has similar technologic characteristics
to the predicate devices in that it contains a metal electrode tip that is used to deliver
monopolar energy to the surgical site. In all devices the electrode tip is in the shape of a
needle. All devices are designed to be connected to electrosurgical generators, and utilize
RF monopolar energy for operation.
The EES device is similar to the Boston Scientific RX Needle Knife in that it consists of
an clongated flexible wire shaft and a handle. These devices allow for the manipulation

of the needle knife via the handle of the device. In addition, the EES device features
rotation and articulation of the end-effector to provide the clinician with improved tissue
targeting capability.

Performance Data. Bench testing was performed to demonstrate that the EES device
performs as intended. The device materials have been evaluated for biocompatibility and
comply with the requirements of ISO 10993-1. The device was tested to demonstrate
compliance with the following standards:

- AAMI/ ANSI HF 18:2001, Electrosurgical Devices

- IEC/EN 60601 -2-2:2000, Medical electrical Equipment — Part 2-2: Particular
requirements for the safety of high frequency surgical equipment

- IEC/EN 60601-2-18:1996, Medical electrical equipment — Part 2. Particular
requirements for safety — Section 2.18 Specification for endoscopic equipment

Dear Ms. Marsh:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class IH (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
{f you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
