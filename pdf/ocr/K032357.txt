Iv. Product Description
The Novus TTx Laser is an air cooled, solid-state, diode laser system intended for use in
the treatment of ocular pathology as stated in Section V. The Novus TTx is a
semiconductor diode laser that operates at a single wavelength, 810nm, with treatment
beam power output ranging from 0 to 2 Watts. A red diode laser provides a visible

aiming beam. The Novus Varia system is comprised of the following functional

components: a laser console; control and display panel; system microprocessor control

electronics; a covered footswitch; operating software; an optional remote control unit;
and delivery devices with accessories. Compatible delivery devices include: the

LaserLink Z and LaserLink Z-1000 Slit Lamp Delivery Adapters, the LaserLink HS Slit

Lamp Delivery Adapter, the LaserLink Large Spot Slit Lamp Delivery Adapters

(LaserLink HS, LaserLinkZ and Universal LaserLink), the Laser Indirect

Ophthalmoscope, and the Acculite Endophotocoagulation Probe Delivery System

(Acculite EndoOcular Probe/Endokit).

Vv. Indications for Use

The Novus TTx Laser and Delivery Devices is intended for use in the treatment of ocular

pathology. The Novus TTx is indicated for use in photocoagulation of both anterior and

posterior segments including:

e Retinal photocoagulation, panretinal photocoagulation, and intravitreal
endophotocoagulation of vascular and structural abnormalities of the retina and
choroid including:

- Diabetic retinopathy (proliferative retinopathy, nonproliferative retinopathy,
macular edema);

- Retinal tears, detachments and holes

- Lattice degeneration

- Age-related macular degeneration

- Intraocular tumors (choroidal hemangioma, choroidal melanoma, retinoblastoma)

- Retinopathy of prematurity

- Choroidal neovascularization;

- Central and branch retinal vein occlusion;

¢ Iridotomy, iridectomy and trabeculoplasty in angle closure glaucoma and open
angle glaucoma

Laser Indirect Ophthalmoscope

The Laser Indirect Ophthalmoscope is indicated for use in the following ophthalmic

treatments: diabetic retinopathy (panretinal photocoagulation); retinopexy; segmental

peripheral photocoagulation; segmental photocoagulation; cloudy vitreous cavities; and,
pediatric retinal repairs (under general anesthesia).

Endophotocoagulation

The Acculite Endoprobe is indicated for use in the following ophthalmic applications:

photocoagulation of the anterior and posterior segment, including: anterior segmat

treatment in the surgical management of glaucoma; endophotocoagulation in vitreoretinal
surgery, including panretinal photocoagulation, retinopexy, and treatment of
neovascularization.

VI. Rationale for Substantial Equivalence
The TTx Laser and Delivery Devices with Accessories have the same intended uses and
indications for use as the predicate devices, and have similar technological characteristics
as the predicate devices - treatment wavelength, laser media, mode of operation, power
output, exposure duration, treatment intervals, spot sizes, aiming beam, cooling system,
laser energy delivery control (footswitch), and delivery systems - as the predicate
devices, and therefore is substantially equivalent to the predicate devices referenced in
Section II

VII. Performance Data
System and software hazard analysis information, software verification and validation
information, and clinical literature were submitted in conjunction with this Premarket
Notification submission. The determination of substantial equivalence was based upon
the comparison of the technical characteristics between the Novus TTx Laser and
Delivery Devices and the predicate laser systems and the evaluation of the performance
data.

VIIE. Conclusion
The Novus TTx Laser and Delivery Devices are substantially equivalent to similar
predicate laser devices, delivery systems and accessories. The Novus TTx Laser and
Delivery Devices share the same intended use, indications for use, and technological
characteristics as the predicate laser systems.

Dear Ms. Baker:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class I] (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market. :
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801). please
contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
