General Device . The Dornier Meditas D Family Lasers are continuous-wave

Description: diode laser emitting laser radiation in the invisible range of
940 nm. Each is calibrated during the manufacturing process
and during service calls. The end-user does not calibrate
fibers for this system. The Medilas D Family Lasers
incorporate a graphic display panel, which shows laser
operating parameters, application modes, time functions,
system status and messages for the user. The Medilas D
Family Lasers feature several operating modes, including
Standard, Fibertom, LITT and LPS. The lasers can be used
in contact or non-contact open surgery with or without
handpieces.

Technological From a clinical perspective and comparing design

. Characteristics: specifications, the Dornier Medifas D Family Lasers and the
predicate device are substantially equivalent. Based on the
technological characteristics and overall performance of the
devices, Dornier MedTech America, Inc. believes that no
significant differences exist between the proposed diode
lasers and the predicate devices.

. Dornier MedTech America, Inc. believes the minor differences
of the Medilas D Family Lasers ant its predicates laser should
not raise any concerns regarding the overall safety or
effectiveness.

Performance Data: While no performance standards have been established for
Diode lasers under Section 514 of the Federal Food, Drug,

‘ and Cosmetic Act, the Dornier Medilas D Family Lasers are in
compliance with class !V performance standards for light
emitting products promulgated under the Radiation Control for
Health and Safety Act of 1968. See 21 C.F.R. §1040.10 and
§1040.11. The lasers also comply with the applicable
requirements of the following voluntary standards: IEC 606011, IEC 60601-1-6, IEC 60601-2-22, IEC 60825-1, and
European Medical Device Directive (CE).

, Conclusion: Based on the technological characteristics and overall
performance of the devices, Dornier MedTech America, Inc. .
believes that the Medilas D Family Lasers and the predicate
device selected are substantially equivalent and that the
differences between the devices are minor which do not raise
new issues of safety or effectiveness. :

’ Dear Mr. Gober:
‘ We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
' for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate .

: commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to :
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food; Drug;-_—_---_—
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).

You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The .
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and ;
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class I] (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
