Common Name: ElectroSurgical Unit (ESU/Generator)
Trade/Proprietary Name: ERBE ESU Model VIO 200 S
Classification Name: Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation device and

accessories (21 CFR 878.4400)
Product Code: 79GEl
Legally Marketed
Predicate Device: ERBE VIO ESU (Model VIO 300 D), 510(k) Number:

K060484
Device Description:
The ERBE ESU Model VIO 200 S$ is an ESU that uses High Frequency (HF)
electrical current waveforms to cut and/or coagulate tissue. It has a display as well
as various cutting and coagulation modes with defined effect levels to provide the
physician flexibility in interventional applications (i.e. its ability to generate the HF
current). The system has automatic start and stop features. The equipment is
programmable and various accessories (e.g. footswitches, hand instruments, etc.)
as well as modes may be assigned to perform specific functions. When activated,
the device has an audio as well as a visual erroring system (i.e. malfunctions or user
errors are detected with medical personnel being alerted visually and/or by sound
with, in some cases, no energy being delivered.). Also, the ESU can be used in
association with an ERBE compatible Argon Plasma Coagulator (APC). The unit is
supplied non-sterile and is reusable.
Note: VIO stands for Variable Cut and Coagulation.

Intended Use:
The ERBE ESU Model VIO 200 § is intended to deliver high frequency electrical
current for the cutting and/or coagulation of tissue.
Similarities and Differences of the Modified Device to the Current Device (Predicate
Comparison/Substantial Equivalence):
Similarities
The modified ESU (ERBE Model VIO 200 S) has the same intended use, protective
circuits, and uses the same basic accessories (i.e. A/C Cord, Footswitches,
Adapters, etc.) as the predicate ESU (ERBE Model VIO 300 D). Also, the available

Modes [i.e. Auto Cut, Endo Cut Q, Endo Cut, Soft Coag, Forced Coag, Bipolar Soft
Coag with and without (Auto Stop] in the modified device are the same Modes that
are in the predicate (Note: Some Modes have power limitations with the modified
device as compared to the predicate.). Both Generators have user interface
displays to select modes, power settings, etc. The modified and predicate devices
are programmable and have Auto Start and Auto Stop functions. Also, each unit has
audio and visual error monitoring. The modified and predicate devices both can be
used with compatible APCs with the respective APC being controlled through the
ESU. Both models have the actual software for the APC within the ESU. The
available APC related Modes (i.¢., Forced APC as well as Argon-assisted Auto Cut,
Forced Coag, and Soft Coag), for the modified device are the same as the predicate
device (Note: Some Modes have power limitations with the modified device as
compared to the predicate.). The modified ESU is also manufactured by ERBE
Elektromedizin GmbH in Germany and like the predicate Generator will be supplied
as non-sterile and is reusable. The packaging is also the same for each device with
similar labeling (e.g. Outer Package Label, User Manual, etc.).
Differences
The ERBE ESU Model VIO 200 S$ is different than the predicate VIO 300 D Model in
that the modified ESU’s display has Light Emitting: Diodes (LEDs) for effect and
wattage settings and it does not have an onscreen tutorial. However, it is easy for
the user to interface with the display screen of the modified ESU. Also, there is a
“Tutorial” section in its User Manual. There are less programming capabilities for the
proposed device [nine (9) program possibilities} compared with 99 for the predicate
ESU. However, only having 9 or less programs is adequate and there is less
confusion with the smaller number. In regards to hardware features of the modified
ESU, the unit was not designed with a Multi-Function (MF) module/receptacle and
the associated specialty Mode (BiClamp) will not be offered with the modified device.

Special 510(k) &. 2 4@
The ERBE ESU Model VIO 200 S also is different than the ERBE VIO 300 D ESU in
that the available wattage is less (i.e. 200 watts compared to 300 watts). However,
a maximum 200 watt Generator has been found to be more than adequate (Note:
The many ESUs on the U.S. market with maximum wattage being less than 200
watts.). With the limitation in power, the modified device doesn't have the capability
of displaying the actual power delivered. Nonetheless, like the predicate device in
the Cut and Coag Modes, the modified device still only delivers the amount of power
needed.
Finally, there is no ReMode feature and less Modes with the modified device as
compared to the predicate. Modes that are in the predicate and not in the modified

/ device are High Cut, Dry Cut, Dry Cut °, Precise Cut, Swift Coag, Swift Coag °,
Spray Coag, Precise Coag, Twin Coag, Bipolar Cut, Bipolar Cut +, Bipolar Precise
Cut, Bipolar Soft Coag +, Bipolar Forced Coag, BiClamp, Bipolar Precise Coag,
Precise APC, Pulsed APC, Argon-assisted High Cut, Argon-assisted Dry Cut, Argonassisted Dry Cut °, Argon-assisted Swift Coag, Argon-assisted Swift Coag °, and
Argon-assisted Twin Coag (Note: Only some of these Modes were standard with the
predicate device.). Even though there are fewer modes within the ERBE Model VIO
200 S, the modes that are present are the principal ones to perform essential cutting
and coagulating activities.

; Conclusion:
The ERBE ESU Model VIO 200 S has the same intended use, principles of
operation, and technological characteristics as the predicate ESU in the previously
cleared 510(k). The modifications involve having a Generator that is more basic (i.e.
less complicated with fundamental Modes thus having a more cost effective unit).
Nonetheless, the modified ESU is an efficient unit. In conclusion, all the changes
were verified or validated. As a result, the changes did not raise safety or efficacy
concerns nor adversely affect safety or effectiveness.

Dear Mr. Tarial:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2.— Mr. John Tartal
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
