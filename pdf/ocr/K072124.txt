2. Name of Device
Trade or Proprietary Name: Black and Black Electrosurgical Cutting and
Coagulation Forceps and Electrodes
Common Name: Monopolar electrosurgical device
Classification Name: Class II, 21 CFR 878.4400, Electrosurgical Cutting and
Coagulation Device and Accessories, Panel 79, GEI,
General and Plastic Surgery
3. Predicate Devices
The Black and Black Surgical monopolar forceps and electrodes are
substantially in function and intended use to the Colorado MicroDissection
Needle (K033232), Valleylab Bayonet Forceps, Conmed Bayonet Straight Tip
with Cable, Snowden-Pencer Endo-Plastic Electrosurgical Dissector,
Snowden-Pencer Monopolar Insulated Forceps, and Olsen Hand Activated
Monopolar Forceps. All devices are used for monopolar electrosurgery,
allowing the surgeon to actuate the electrosurgical generator from the sterile
field using either push button controls or a foot switch on the device.
4. Device Description
The Black and Black monopolar forceps and electrodes are handheld, reusable
devices designed to deliver monopolar RF electrosurgical energy to a surgical
site to cut and/or coagulate tissue.

(Device Description continued)
The surgeon activates the desired electrosurgical mode from the sterile field
by using buttons on the device. Three electrosurgical modes are available:
- Cut: cuts tissue with minimal coagulation / hemostasis
- Hemostasis with Division: divides tissue with controlled
hemostasis
- Coag: coagulates bleeding vessels to promote hemostasis
5. Intended Use
The Black and Black monopolar forceps and electrodes are reusable devices
intended for use in surgical procedures (such as general, urologic, thoracic,
plastic and reconstructive, gynecologic, arthroscopic) where the surgeon
desires monopolar radio-frequency electrosurgical energy to cut and/or
coagulate tissue.
There are no specific contraindications associated with the Black and Black
monopolar forceps and electrodes.
6. Summary of Technological Characteristics
The Black and Black monopolar forceps and electrodes have the same basic
technological characteristics as the predicate devices noted above.

Dear Mr. Black.:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 — Mr. Norman Black
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance
