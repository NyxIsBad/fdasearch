Device Description: The BIOSYAG MEDICAL SYSTEM is a modular multilaser and multi-use device for the cosmetic treatment of face
and body. It is used to treat common imperfections and
lesions of skin and body.
The BIOSYAG MEDICAL SYSTEM includes the
following light sources:
o Nd:YAG 50 J (internal laser source)
o Nd:YAG Q-switched (handpiece)
o ErYAG (handpiece)
o Pulsed Light source
The handpiece is the part that the user grips to carry out the
laser treatment and consists of a main body and a removable
end section that defines the size of the work beam.
At the resonator lead-in an appropriately dimensioned fibre
is connected with a focussing device fitted on the end, used
to treat the patient.

The system is supplicd with a set of adapters to be able to
use different work beam dimensions.
The cooling section consists of a deionised water/air heat
exchanger.
The foreseen operating cycle is intermittent, operating at
maximum power for 10 minutes, followed by a 5 minute
pause.
The management of the source and the work parameters is
by means of a control panel with a liquid crystal colour
screen and touch screen functions.
Intended Use: The Intended Uses for the BIOSYAG MEDICAL SYSTEM
are the following:
1. The removal of unwanted hair and to effect stable long
term or permanent hair reduction,
2, Laser skin treatment procedures for the treatment of:
® acne scars
e wrinkles
3. Incision, excision, ablation, vaporization of soft tissue,
4. The non-ablative treatment of facial wrinkles, such as, but
not limited to:
e  periocular wrinkles
e perioral wrinkles
5. Removal of tattoos and blemishes of the skin, the treatment
of various pigmentation lesions.
6. Treatment of capillaries, teleangiectasies and vascular
lesions.
7, Treatment of vitiligo and psoriasis.
The correlation between type of light source, wavelength, and intended usc is outlined in the
table displayed on the following table.

Pulsed Light | 300- 1000 - Treatment of vitiligo and psoriasis (300-380 nm).
- The removal of unwanted hair and to effect stable long term or
permanent hair reduction (420-950 nm),
Rationale for Substantial The product specification, functionality, indication for use,
Equivalence: and treatment parameters of the APL MEDICAL SYSTEM
are the same or very similar to the legally marketed laser
Bios Italia srl — Bios Yag 50 Med and APL Medical System.
Both systems have the same indication for use.
Both systems comprise a flashlamp pumped laser rod
(Nd:YAG) generating light at a wavelength of 1064 nm,
which is subsequently delivered to the patient via an optical
fiber delivery system, and focusing handpiece.
The BIOSYAG MEDICAL SYSTEM output characteristics
(including pulse duration and fluence) are identical, or very
similar, to those of the predicate device.
Both lasers utilize class INA aiming beams.
Both lasers are microprocessor controlled devices.
Both systems utilize an internal closed loop water-air heath
exchanger circuit for optimal thermal control of laser cavity
The risks and benefits for the BIOSYAG MEDICAL
SYSTEM are comparable to those for the predicate device.
Therefore, the introduction of this laser should not raise new
questions of Safety and Effectiveness.

Dear Alessandro Franchi:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
