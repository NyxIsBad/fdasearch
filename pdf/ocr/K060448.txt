« The coagulation and hemostasis of vascular lesions and soft tissue,
including:

- Treatment and clearance of superficial and deep telangiectasias
(venulectasias) and reticular veins (0.1 — 4.0 mm diameter) of the
leg;

* The removal of unwanted hair from all skin types, and to effect stable ~
long-term, or permanent’, hair reduction in skin types I-V through
selective targeting of melanin in hair follicles;

© The non-ablative treatment of facial wrinkles.
> LightSheer Diode Laser Wavelength (800 nm):

The 800 nm wavelength produced by the LightSheer diode laser is ‘

indicated for:

* The removal of unwanted hair, and to effect stable long-term, or
permanent’, hair reduction through selective targeting of melanin in
hair follicles;

¢ The treatment of vascular lesions, including angiomas, hemangiomas
telangiectasia and other benign vascular lesions;

> Aluma RF Energy (468 kHz):
The Aluma 468 kHz energy is indicated for:
¢ The Aluma Skin Renewal System is intended for use in Dermatologic and General
Surgical procedures for the non-invasive treatment of wrinkles and thytids.
VI. Rationale for Substantial Equivalence
The Lumenis One Family of Systems share the same intended uses as the predicate
devices—the Lumenis Family of Intense Pulsed-Light (IPL) and IPL/Nd: YAG Laser
Systems (K020839, K024093, K030342, K030527), the LightSheer Pulsed Diode
Array Laser System (K973324, K974346, K982940, K001746, K003614), and the
Aluma Skin Renewal System (K051214), in that they are intended for use for the
same surgical, aesthetic and cosmetic applications in general and plastic surgery, and
dermatology.
The Lumenis One Family of Systems share the same indications for use as the
predicate devices.
The technical specifications, including the range of treatment parameters, the basic
control system, and delivery devices of the Lumenis One Family of Systems are
identical or similar to the predicate devices.
VII. Safety and Effectiveness Information
The Lumenis One Family of Systems share the same indications for use and the same
or similar technical specifications as the currently marketed predicate Lumenis Family
of Intense Pulsed-Light (IPL) and IPL/Nd: YAG Laser Systems (K020839, K024093,
K030342, KO30527), the LightSheer Pulsed Diode Array Laser System (K973324,
K974346, K982940, K001746, KO03614), and the Aluma Skin Renewal System ~ ,
(K051214). The small differences that exist in certain technical specifications are
not significant and they do not alter the safety or effectiveness of the Lumenis One
Family of Systems. Clinical data therefore was not provided.
VIII. Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, the Lumenis One Family of Systems were found to be
substantially equivalent to the predicate devices, Lumenis Family of Intense PulsedLight (IPL) and IPL/Nd:YAG Laser Systems (K020839, K024093, K030342,
K030527), the LightSheer Pulsed Diode Array Laser System (K973324, K974346,
K982940, K001746, K003614), and the Aluma Skin Renewal System (K051214 ), all
marketed by Lumenis. \
The Lumenis One Family of Systems share the same indications for use and similar or
identical design features, functional features, and technical specifications, and thus are
substantially equivalent to, the currently marketed predicate devices.

Dear Ms. Martha Murari:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for
use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce
prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may.
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices. good
manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is ciassified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional conuols. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be
found in the Code of Federal Regulations. Title 21. Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish
further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or
any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with
all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807):
labeling (21 CFR Part 801): good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality
systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820): and if applicable, the electronic product radiation
control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
