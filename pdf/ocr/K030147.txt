IV. ‘Product Description
The modified Lumenis family of UltraPulse SurgiTouch CO, Laser Systems are
comprised of the following main components:
e A laser console
e A laser console tower
e A counterbalanced articulated arm and delivery system
« Control and display panel
e System microprocessor control electronics

e A variety of delivery device accessories or handpieces, including a pattern generator
Vv. Indications for Use
Lumenis UltraPulse SurgiTouch Carbon Dioxide Surgical Lasers (and their delivery
accessories) are used to deliver light energy and are indicated for use in surgical
applications requiring the ablation, vaporization, excision, incision, and coagulation
of soft tissue in medical specialties including: aesthetic (dermatology and _ plastic
surgery), podiatry, otolaryngology (ENT), gynecology (including laparoscopy),
neurosurgery, orthopedics (soft tissue), arthroscopy (knee), general and thoracic surgery
(including open and endoscopic), dental and oral surgery and genitourinary surgery.

In addition, the Lumenis UltraPulse SurgiTouch Carbon Dioxide Surgical Lasers are safe
and effective when indicated for use in specific surgical applications in medical
specialties including: aesthetic (dermatology and plastic surgery), podiatry,
otolaryngology (ENT), gynecology (including laparoscopy), neurosurgery, orthopedics
(soft tissue), arthroscopy (knee), general and thoracic surgery (including open and
endoscopic), dental and oral surgery and genitourinary surgery.
VI. Rationale for Substantial Equivalence
The modified Lumenis family of UltraPulse SurgiTouch Carbon Dioxide Surgical Lasers
(and their delivery accessories) share the same indications for use, similar design features,
functional features, and therefore are substantially equivalent to the predicate devices,
including the Lumenis UltraPulse Encore CO, Surgical Laser Systems (K022060) and the
Lumenis (formerly Coherent Medical Group) UltraPulse CO, Surgical Laser Systems
(K963339). In addition, medical and clinical data demonstrated that UltraPulse
SurgiTouch Carbon Dioxide Surgical Lasers are safe and effective when indicated for use
of additional specific applications in a variety of medical specialties.
VII. Safety and Effectiveness Information
Medical and clinical study information was provided to demonstrate that the modified
Lumenis family of UltraPulse SurgiTouch Carbon Dioxide Surgical Lasers are safe and
effective, when indicated in specific applications in the medical specialties of aesthetic ,
(dermatology and plastic surgery), podiatry, otolaryngology (ENT), gynecology (including
laparoscopy), neurosurgery, orthopedics (soft tissue), arthroscopy (knee), general and
thoracic surgery (including open and endoscopic), dental and oral surgery and
genitourinary surgery.
VIII. Conclusion
The modified Lumenis family of UltraPulse SurgiTouch Carbon Dioxide Surgical Lasers
(and their delivery accessories) were found to be substantially equivalent to the predicate
Lumenis family of UltraPulse Encore Carbon Dioxide Surgical Lasers (K022060), and to
the Lumenis family of UltraPulse Carbon Dioxide Surgical Lasers (K963339). The
modified Lumenis family of UltraPulse SurgiTouch Carbon Dioxide Surgical Lasers share
the same intended uses, similar indications for use, and identical technological
characteristics, and thus are substantially equivalent to, the currently marketed predicate
devices.
Medical and clinical study information was provided to demonstrate that the modified
Lumenis family of UltraPulse SurgiTouch Carbon Dioxide Surgical Lasers are safe and
effective, when indicated in specific applications in the medical specialties of aesthetic
(dermatology and plastic surgery), podiatry, otolaryngology (ENT), gynecology (including
laparoscopy), neurosurgery, orthopedics (soft tissue), arthroscopy (knee), general and
thoracic surgery (including open and endoscopic), dental and oral surgery and
genitourinary surgery.

Dated: January 13, 2003
Received: January 15, 2003 :
Dear Ms. Worden:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 - Ms. Anne C. Worden
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Additionally, for questions on the
promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 5944639. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket
