Common Name: Electrosurgical Unit and Accessories
Classification Name: Electrosurgical Cutting and Coagulation Device and accessories (21 CFR
878.4400)
79 GEl
Predicate Device: System 7500° Electrosurgical Unit, K981220, cleared 27-April-1998
ABC® Probe for Flexible Endoscopes, K990586, cleared 17-May-1999
Device Description: The System 7500°-B is an electrosurgical generator with Argon Beam
Coagulation (ABC”) capability. The basic modes of operation are conventional electrosurgical
cutting, coagulation plus argon beam coagulation. When cutting, the edge of the electrode is drawn
across the tissue while electrosurgical energy is being applied. When coagulating, the accessory
electrode or argon beam may be held in contact with the tissue for desiccation or separated from the
tissue by distance for fulguration to achieve the desired result. The ABCFlex™ Probe has
applications in endoscopic surgical procedures such as upper and lower gastroenterology and
bronchoscopy to provide a means of coagulation using electrosurgical current and argon gas. The
device consists of a connector for delivering argon gas to the operative site as well as an internal
cable to carry high frequency (HF) electrosurgical current to a tungsten electrode tip at the end of the
tubing. A ceramic tip insulates the thermal plastic tubing from the heat generated during coagulation.
The electrode is positioned in the ceramic tip such that it cannot contact the patient's tissue during
the coagulation procedure. Current and gas flow is controlled by the surgeon activating and
deactivating a switching element part of the System 7500°-B ESU.
Intended Use of Device: The System 7500°-B is used for the destruction of human tissue in surgical
procedures to provide a therapeutic benefit. The ABCFlex™ Probe is intended for use with the
System 7500°-B for non-contact superficial ablation and hemostasis through a flexible endoscope to
the operative site.
Technological Characteristics: The proposed devices are equivalent to the identified predicate
devices with respect to technological characteristics and function. The devices have been designed
to comply with the applicable sections of ANSI/AAMI American National Standard for Electrosurgical
Devices HF-18, the International Electrotechnical Commission Standard for Electrosurgical Devices,
IEC 60601-1, 60601-1-1, 60601-1-2, 60601-1-4, 60601-2-2, Sterilization of health care products —
Requirements for validation and routine contro! of Ethylene Oxide Sterilization, ISO 11135 and
Biocompatibility, ISO 10993.

Dear Ms. Vetter:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug.
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
: adulteration.
{f your device is classified (see above) into either class I] (Special Controls) or class I] (PMA). it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section $10(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.

/ If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
