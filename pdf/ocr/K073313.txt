Description:
The OmniGuide OmniGuide Beam Path COQ) Mark III WaveGuide Fiber with Low
Profile Tip is an accessory for CO, laser systems. It consists of a flexible fiber assembly
that delivers CO laser energy that enables minimally invasive surgery. OmmniGuide
Beam Path CO2 Mark II] WaveGuide Fiber with low profile metal tip is supplied sterile
and is intended for single procedure use in conjunction with the OmniGuide Laser
Adapter.
Intended Use:
The OmniGuide Beam Path CO Mark IIT WaveGuide Fiber with Low Profile Tip is
indicated for the incision, excision, ablation, vaporization and coagulation of body soft
tissues including intra-oral tissues. It is indicated in the medical specialties of general and
plastic surgery, oral/maxillofacial surgery, dentistry, dermatology, gynecology,
otorhinolaryngology, gastroenterology, neurosurgery, urology, and pulmonology, and can
be used in open surgical procedures as well as endoscopic minimally invasive procedures
in conjunction with rigid or flexible endoscopes, such as in laryngoscopy, gastroscopy,
colonoscopy, laparoscopy, thoracoscopy, hysteroscopy and bronchoscopy.
The indications for use for which the delivery system is used for are dependent upon the
cleared indications for use of the laser system and those laser system accessories to which
it is attached.
Summary of Technological Characteristics:
The device consists of an optical fiber assembly. The main functional component of the
fiber assembly is a photonic bandgap reflector lining its hollow core that reflects and
thereby guides CQ, laser energy and a stainless steel waveguide distal tip. The fiber
assembly is 1 to 2 m long and transmits at the CO, laser emission wavelength of 10.6 um.
The fiber has 14 mm long stainless steel tip that is used as a continuation of the
waveguide, which enhances visualization in tight areas.
Performance Data:
Non-clinical Performance Data: The OmniGuide Beam Path CO) Mark II WaveGuide
Fiber with Low Profile Tip performance characteristics have been evaluated through
testing and analysis of laser power output and beam quality. This type of testing complies
with the respective section of the FDA Guidance on the Content and Organization of a
Premarket Notification for a Medical Laser (1995) and is similar to the predicate device
tests. The performance of OmniGuide Beam Path CO2 Mark IIT WaveGuide Fiber with
Low Profile Tip and the related parameters of the predicate devices are comparable.
Clinical Performance Data: Formal clinical trials were not deemed necessary as the
device is using the same technology and intended use as the predicate devices.
Conclusions Drawn from Tests and Analysis: The intended use and major performance
parameters (energy transmission levels and beam quality) of the OmniGuide Beam Path
CO2 Mark IIT WaveGuide Fiber with Low Profile Tip are similar or equivalent to the
characteristics of above mentioned legally marketed devices.

Dear Mr. Job:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class Ili (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0120. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
