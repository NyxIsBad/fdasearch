Device Trade Name MultiWave XR Common Name Medica! Laser System
Classification Name _Laser surgical instrument for use in general and plastic surgery and
dermatology (21 CFR 878.4810), Class II
Product Code: GEX — Laser, instrument, surgical, powered
Panel: 79
Predicate Devices 1). GentleY AG (Candela), K022951, K023193
2). GentleLASE GL (Candela), K994260
3). Gemini (Laserscope), K034011
4). Aura i (Laserscope), K024206
5). Apogee Elite (Cynosure), K034030
6). Adept 1064/532/755 Laser (Adept Medical Concepts) K032218
Device Description The MultiWave XR combines three laser outputs in a single device.
It produces a long pulse laser light of 532 nm, 755 nm, and 1064 nm
wavelengths. The laser head has two optical cavities containing an
Alexandrite crystal rod (755 nm) and a Nd:YAG crystal rod (1064
nm) with optional frequency doubler installed (532 nm). Pulsed laser
energy accomplished with a red aiming beam of low energy (SmW,
635nm) is delivered to a target via an optical fiber and a handpiece.
Each laser outlet has own fiber and handpiece. Chilled air is
delivered to the same target via jets in a handpiece.

Intended Use The MultiWave XR laser system is indicated for permanent hair
removal, for treatment of vascular lesions, pigmented lesions,
and wrinkles

10.2. Appendix B (Summary of Substantial Equivalence)
Summary of Substantial Equivalence
Pacific Quantum Instrument, Inc. believes that its MultiWave XR laser system is substantially
equivalent:
a) regarding all three available in MultiWave XR laser emissions together
(1064 nm, 755 nm and 532 nm), to the legally marketed device:
Adept 1064/532/755 Laser (Adept Medical Concepts, Inc., K032218);
b) regarding 1064 nm laser emission, to the following legally marketed devices:
Adept 1064/532/755 Laser (K032218), GentleYAG (Candela, K022951), Gemini
(Laserscope, K034011), Apogee Elite (Cynosure, K034030);
c) regarding 755 nm laser emission, to the following legally marketed devices:
Adept 1064/532/755 Laser (K032218), GentleLASE GL (Candela, K994260), Apogee Elite
(Cynosure, K034030);
d) regarding 532 nm laser emission, to the following legally marketed devices:
Adept 1064/532/755 Laser (K032218), Gemini (Laserscope, K034011), Aura i
(Laserscope, K024206). :
All these predicate devices previously cleared for medical applications, which include all
Indications for Use of MultiWave XR proposed by Pacific Quantum Instruments, Inc. in the
Indications for Use Statement (see Appendix 10.3)
Technologically, the predicate devices have identical characteristics to the MultiWave XR
laser system, all comprising a flash lamp pumped Nd:YAG laser rod generating light at 1064
nm or 532 nm, or a flash lamp pumped Alexandrite laser rod generating light at 755 nm,
which is subsequently delivered to the patient via individual optical fiber delivery system
and focusing handpiece.
Moreover, all lasers are microprocessor controlled devices with internal closed water-air
laser cooling system, and Class I, 635 nm, aiming pilot lasers, which pose no hazard to the
user.
The risk and benefits of the MultiWave XR laser system are comparable to the predicate
devices when used for similar applications. It is therefore believed that there are no NEW
questions of Safety and Effectiveness raised by the introduction of this device: MultiWave
XR laser system.

Dear Dr. Nikolaenko:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation contro] provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act), 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2- Gennady L. Nikolaenko, Ph.D.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
