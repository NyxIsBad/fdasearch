SECTION 11__ SUMMARY OF SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS
4, A description of the device that is the subject of the 510(k):
The Pascal laser photocoagulator is an integrated system comprising solid state aiming and
treatment lasers, control electronics, graphical user interface, slit-lamp, and table. It is
intended for use in the treatment of ocular pathology.
5. Statement of intended use:
The Pascal Photocoagulator indications for use are the following:
Intended for use in the treatment of ocular pathology in both the posterior and anterior
segments.
Retinal photocoagulation, panretinal photocoagulation, focal photocoagulation and grid
photocoagulation for vascular and structural abnormalities of the retina and choroid
including:
= proliferative and nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy
= macular edema
= choroidal neovascularization
= branch and central retinal vein occlusion
= age-related macular degeneration
= — lattice degeneration
= retinal tears and detachments
: . © Iridotomy, iridectomy and trabeculoplasty in angle closure and open
angle glaucoma.
6. Statement of how the technological characteristics of the device compare to those
of the predicate or legally marketed device.
The Pascal™ Retinal Photocoagulator system shares the same intended use, indications for
use and the same or similar technological characteristics (including treatment wavelengths,
laser active medium, pumping system, aiming beam, mode of operation, exposure duration,
power, treatment intervals, spot size, semi-automatic repeat mode, controls and displays, laser
energy delivery control (foot switch), and slit lamp delivery, and therefore is substantially
equivalent to the predicate devices referenced in Item 3.
7. Brief summary of nonclinical tests and results:
Performance test results, as well as system and software hazard analysis information and system and
software verification and validation information, have been submitted in conjunction with this
Premarket Notification submission. The determination of substantial equivalence was based on the
comparison of the technical characteristics between the Pascal Retinal Photocoagulator and the
predicate laser systems.
8. Conclusion
The Pascal Retinal Photocoagulator is substantially equivalent to similar predicate laser
devices and slit lamp delivery systems. The Pascal Retinal Photocoagulator shares the same
intended use, indications for use, and technological characteristics as the predicate
ophthalmic laser systems.

Dear Dr. Gordon:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class {I (Special Controls) or class I] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may ,
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act), 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 - Judy F. Gordon, D.V.M.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
