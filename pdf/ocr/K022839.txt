If, Description
The Fotona DUALIS* Plus system is based on the Nd:YAG laser technology. Within the
system, an optical cavity contains the Nd:YAG crystal, which is activated by means of the
use of flashlamps. After the cavity, a red diode aiming beam is reflected onto a coaxial
beam path using a beamsplitter assembly. The combined therapeutic and aiming beams are
guided down an optical fiber delivery system to a focusing handpiece. The laser is used in
non-contact mode.
II. Intended Use
The Fotona DUALIS*® Plus Nd:YAG laser system is indicated for use in surgical and
aesthetic applications requiring selective photothermolysis of target chromophores in soft
tissue in general and plastic surgery and dermatology. In addition, the system is indicated
to effect stable long-term, or permanent hair reduction in Fitzpatrick skin types I - VI
through selective targeting of melanin in hair follicles (where permanent hair reduction is
defined as a long-term stable reduction in number of hairs regrowing after a treatment
regimen).
IH, Summary of Substantial Equivalence
The Fotona DUALIS* Plus laser shares the same general indications for use, and
therefore is substantially equivalent to the currently marketed Altus Medical Aesthetic
Nd:YAG Laser.

Technologically, the predicate device has similar characteristics to the DUALIS*” Plus
laser. Both systems comprising a flashlamp pumped Nd:YAG laser rod generating light at
a wavelength of 1064 nm, which is subsequently delivered to the patient via an optical
fiber delivery system and focusing handpiece.

Both lasers utilize class I aiming beams which pose no hazard to the user.
Both systems are microprocessor controlled devices. The microprocessor control
regulates normal operation, permits parameter selection and avoids hazard incidence.
Both systems utilize an internal closed loop water-air heat exchanger circuit for optimal
thermal control of the laser cavity.
The risk and benefits for the DUALIS*? Plus laser system are comparable to the predicate
device when used for similar clinical applications.
It is therefore believed that there are no new questions of Safety or Effectiveness raised by
the introduction of the DUALIS*? Plus laser system.

Dear Sir or Madam:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for
use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce
prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good
manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply
with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part
807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the

a - "-Pagé 2-SirorMadam | a re

: radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR.1000-1050.
: This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) .
. ~ premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
, marketed predicate device results in a classification for-your device and thus, permits your device
- to proceed to the market. . ‘
" If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please ;

contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Additionally, for questions.on the promotion
and advertising of your device, please contact the Office-of Compliance at (301) 594-4639. Also,
