XTRAC Excimer Laser

4. DEVICE DESCRIPTION

The XTRAC Excimer Laser System is a complete self-contained compact UV laser

light source, which utilizes a XeC1 gas mixture to generate an operator selected dose
and target-specific ultraviolet light at wavelength of 308 nm. The laser system

consists of a keypad and display, a fiberoptic delivery system, a handpiece and a foot
switch. The laser is enclosed in a protective interlocked housing.

5. INTENDED USE

The intended use is targeted UVB phototherapy for psoriasis, vitiligo, atopic

dermatitis, and non-autoimmune based leukoderma of affected skin.

6. SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE

The application of the XTRAC Excimer Laser System has been proven to be

substantially equivalent to current legally marketed devices in the treatment of vitiligo
- via K003705. In that application, PhotoMedex demonstrated that narrow-band UV-B

311 alone had been shown to be just as effective in the treatment of vitiligo as PUVA

(Westerhof and Nieuweboer-Krobotova‘). The authors in this study concluded, “the

treatment of vitiligo with narrow-band UV-B twice weekly is a safe and effective

treatment.” Vitiligo, which is recognized as a cosmetic problem, is a form of

leukoderma.

Current published data supports narrow-band UVB (utilizing ultraviolet lamp

sources) to be effective in the regimentation of skin which has been affected by

leukoderma such as the latent hypopigmentation, which is frequently experienced in

complications resulting from carbon dioxide lasers used for skin resurfacing.

The intended use for the PhotoMedex XTRAC Excimer Laser System is within the

scope of the predicate ultraviolet lamps. Both device types share the same methods

and mechanisms (UVB light) to produce a result for the purpose of dermatological

phototherapy.

The XTRAC Excimer Laser System, model AL7000 is currently market cleared for

other skin conditions where UVB phototherapy has shown to be safe and effective via

510(k) numbers K992914, K003705, and K011382.

7. CLINICAL PERFORMANCE TESTING :
Verification and validation to substantiate inclusion of the indication of UVB
phototherapy for the treatment of leukoderma by the AL7000 is supported in a
clinical study’ which utilized a 308nm excimer laser to successfully induce
repigmentation on subjects. These subjects had experienced hypopigmentation
(leukoderma) as a result of carbon dioxide laser resurfacing, and confirmed a 50% to
75% improvement or greater in treating leukoderma.
8 PRODUCT PERFORMANCE TESTING
Testing conducted on the XTRAC Excimer Laser System includes conformance to all
relevant international EN 60601 series of standards, 21 CFR Part 1040.10 & 1040.11
Performance Standards for Light-Emitting Products and is a UL 2601 classified
device.
- 9, CONCLUSIONS
Based on the same intended use as UVB sources for phototherapy, the previously
cleared technological characteristics of the XTRAC Excimer Laser (which are
unchanged to support this additional indication), and the performance data,
PhotoMedex believes that the XTRAC Excimer Laser System is substantially
equivalent to the predicate devices.

Dear Mr. Rose:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
. general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
