Conclusion:
MedArt 610 applications and indications are evaluated to be within the scope of the previously cleared devices. The same counts for the essential treatment parameters, the protective conditions for the skin during treatment, and the working conditions of the physician.
Based on this side-by-side comparison of the overall performance characteristics of the
predicate devices under consideration MedArt A/S concludes that no significant differences exist. The MedArt 610 should not raise any new issues of safety and effectiveness and
is judged to be substantially equivalent to the mentioned predicate devices.
