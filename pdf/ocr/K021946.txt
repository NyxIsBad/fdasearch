Common Name: Erbium: YAG laser device

Classification Name: Instrument, Powered, Laser
79-GEX
21 CFR 878-48

Legally Marketed Predicate Schwartz Electro-Optics TriLase2940, K# 954013

Device: Cell Robotics Er: YAG Laser System, K# 970461
Asceplion-Meditec Dermastar Er;:Y AG Laser System,
K#014057

Description of the Device The Cell Robotics Ultra-Light Laser System is an Er: YAG
laser producing emission at a wavelength of 2940nm. The
laser consists of two interconnected sections: The cabinet
which houses the power supply, the cooling system and
the electronics, and; the umbilical cables and the
handpiece, which houses the laser.

Intended Use of the Device The Cell Robotics, Inc. Ultra-Light Laser System is
intended for coagulation, vaporization, ablation, or cutting
of soft tissue (skin) in dermatology, plastic surgery
(including aesthetic surgery), ora] surgery, and
ophthamology.

Dear Mr. Goff:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

: Page 2 — Mr. Glen Goff : . :
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
: premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
. marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to

proceed to the market. a /
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801 and
additionally 21 CFR Part 809.10 for in vitro diagnostic devices), please contact the Office of
Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Additionally, for questions on the promotion and advertising of
your device, please contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4639. Also, please note the
regulation entitled, “Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21 CFR Part 807.97).
Other general information on your responsibilities under the Act may be obtained from the Division
