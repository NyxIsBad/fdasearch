8.0 510(K) SUMMARY OF SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS
KO 314726

General Trade Name: RITA® Model 1500X Electrosurgical RF Generator and accessories

Provisions (e.g., RITA Thermo Pad and cable adapter)

Common/Classification Name: Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation device

Name of RITA Medical Systems Inc. - Model 1500X Electrosurgical RF Generator and

Predicate accessories (e.g., RITA Dispersive Electrode)

Classification Class II

Performance Performance standards have not been established by the FDA under section 514 of

Standards the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.

Intended Use The Model 1500X Electrosurgical RF Generator and accessories are indicated for
use in percutaneous, laparoscopic, and intraoperative coagulation and ablation of
soft tissue, including the partial or complete ablation of non-resectable liver lesions

. and the palliation of pain associated with metastatic lesions involving bone in
patients who have failed or are not candidates for standard pain therapy.

Device The Model 1500X Electrosurgical RF Generator is designed to provide monopolar

Description radiofrequency (RF) energy. The RF Generator is a 150/200 W electrosurgical

generator specifically designed for use with RITA electrosurgical devices. It can
read multiple temperature sensors and includes impedance and power monitoring to
assist the physician in monitoring and controlling the ablation.
To use the system, the RF Generator is plugged into the wall outlet via the Power
Cord. The electrosurgical device is connected to the RF Generator via the Main
Cable. The Thermo Pad is placed on the appropriate location of the body and is
connected to its ports on the RF Generator via a cable adapter. Once the system is
successfully powered up, the user can set the parameters of the ablation such as the
mode of operation, the ablation time, the target temperature, and the power delivery
level. With the electrosurgical device placed in the tissue to be ablated and its
electrodes deployed, RF power can be tured on. The system parameters are
continuously monitored and displayed on the RF Generator. If the measured
parameters are outside the acceptable limits, the RF energy delivery automatically
stops and a message appears on the liquid crystal display (LCD). The RF energy
delivery also automatically ceases once the ablation is completed based on the
initial user-defined parameters. RF energy can be stopped at any time by pressing
the RF ON/OFF switch.

Performance The Model 1500X RF Generator and accessories were subjected to a battery of

Data electrical, mechanical, and software validation testing.

Dear Mr. Mazzone:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and _.
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class HII (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
