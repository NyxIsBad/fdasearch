(Name) Class I medical device; (21 CFR 878.4810)
Product Code: GEX
Panel: 79
Predicate devices: The ProLite™ Pulsed Light System is substantially equivalent to itself.
Device description: The ProLite™ Pulsed Light System uses a Xenon Flash Lamp which is
filtered to specified wavelengths for its intended uses. The System consists
of a cabinet with power supply, a distilled water cooling system, the
microcontroller, an umbilical which attaches to a handpiece which houses

. The ProLite™ Pulsed Light System, equipped with the SR handpiece and 550 or

- 580 nanometer filter, is intended for the treatment of benign pigmented lesions and
the removal of tattoos, the treatment of vascular lesions, and the treatment of
shallow facial veins, telangiectasia, facial hemangiomas, and rosacea vascular
lesions
The 550 nanometer filter may be more efficient for Types I and I skin.
The 580 nanometer filter may be more efficient for Types III and IV skin.
The Center for Medical Devices and Radiological Health has concluded that the
ProLite™ Pulsed Light System be labeled as a restricted device as follows:
“CAUTION: Federal (US) law restricts the use of this device to licensed

professionals.”

Performance Data: None required. The claim of substantial equivalence is based the fact that the
ProLite™ Pulsed Light System described in this premarket rdtification is the
same as described in several previous premarket notifications. No changes
in specifications, performance characteristics, or, indications for use are
proposed.

CONCLUSION: Based on the information in the notification Big Sky Laser Technologies, Inc.,
believes that ProLite™ Pulsed Light System is substantially equivalent to
itself, i.c., the claimed predicate.

Dear Mr. Maine:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
: referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class IT (Special Controls) or class HI (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
