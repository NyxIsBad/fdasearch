Date Summary Prepared: April 18, 2003

Device Trade Name: Photolight PL

Common Name: Medical Laser System

Classification Name: Instrument, surgical, powered, laser
79-GEX
21 CFR 878.48

Equivalent Device: EsteLux pulsed light system

Device Description: Photolight PL is a intense pulsed light system, having a Xenon
flashlamp located in the handpieces. It is a light source with a range
approximately 400 - 1400 nm wavelength.
Emission activation is by footswitch. Overall weight of the laser is 18
Kg, and the size is 20x48x54 cm (HxWxD).
Electrical requirement is 110 VAC, 15A, 50-60 Hz, single phase.

Intended Use: The Photolight PL is indicated for permanent hair reduction,
photocoagulation of vascular lesions, photothermolysis of blood
vessels, treatment of benign pigmented lesions.
The CoolHand cooling device is intended to provide pre-cooling of the
epidermis, to reduce thermal injury to the epidermis, and to reduce
patient pain and discomfort associated with light applications.

Comparison: The Photolight PL system has an equivalent indication for uses, the
same principle of operation, and essentially the same wavelength
range and pulse energy range as the predicate device.

Nonclinical Performance Data: none

Clinical Performance Data: none

Conclusion: The Photolight PL is another safe and effective device for permanent
hair reduction, photocoagulation of vascular lesions, photothermolysis
of blood vessels, treatment of benign pigmented lesions.

Dear Mr. Cho:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class IH (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
