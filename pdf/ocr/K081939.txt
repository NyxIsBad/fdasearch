Description:
The OmniGuide BeamPath® Fiber Optic HandPiece System and Sterilization Tray is
indicated for use in conjunction with OmniGuide’s waveguide fibers.
The objectives of the hand-piece are to enable precision control and to stabilize surgeon
hand motion. The waveguide fiber is inserted through the proximal end of the hand-piece
and fixated so that it is observed at the hand-piece’s distal tip. The surgeon wields the
hand-piece as a pencil, and advances the hand-piece so that its distal tip is in close
proximity to the target tissue to exert the desired effect of the waveguide fiber: incision,
excision, ablation, vaporization and coagulation. The surgeon may use the hand-piece
distal tip in either non-contact mode or contact mode, and may use the distal tip to enable
tissue manipulation.
The sterilization tray is purchased from SYMMETRY MEDICAL USA INC. and sold as
a storage and sterilization tray for use with the OmniGuide Fiber Optic Handpieces.
Intended Use:
The OmniGuide BeamPath® Fiber Optic HandPiece System and Sterilization Tray is
indicated for use in conjunction with OmniGuide’s waveguide fibers to enable the
surgeon to perform incision, excision, ablation, vaporization and coagulation of body soft
tissues including intra-oral tissues. It is indicated in the medical specialties of general and
plastic surgery, oral/maxillofacial surgery, dentistry, dermatology, gynecology,
otorhinolaryngology, gastroenterology, neurosurgery, urology, and pulmonology.
Summary of Technological Characteristics:
The handpieces consist of a handle and sealing cap consisting of either SS or aluminum, a
silicone rubber fiber gripper and a lumen to guide the fiber made of SS hypodermic
tubing. The handle/lumen are welded or adhesive bonded to for the unit. Lumen may be
bent or straight to facilitate the aiming of the fiber. The tip is may be beveled or straight
to improve the fiber visibility, fiber tip protection and blunt dissection.
Performance Data:
Non-clinical Performance Data: OmniGuide BeamPath® Fiber Optic HandPiece System
and Sterilization Tray performance characteristics have been evaluated through testing
and bench top testing. The handpieces are used to allow the physician to manipulate the
flexible fiber through a surgical endoscope . The performance of the OmniGuide
BeamPath® Fiber Optic HandPiece and similar related parameters of predicate device are
comparable.
Clinical Performance Data: Formal clinical trials were not deemed necessary as the
device is using the same technology and intended use as predicate device.
Conclusions Drawn from Tests and Analysis: The intended use and major performance
parameters of the OmniGuide BeamPath® Fiber Optic HandPiece System and

Dear Mr. Job:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class Il (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CER Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 Mr. Mark Job
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
