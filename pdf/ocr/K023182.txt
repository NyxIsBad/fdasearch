Name of Device
Trade Name: Indigo® OPTIMA Laser System
Classification Name: Laser powered surgical instrument
Predicate Device
Indigo® OPTIMA Laser System (K013493)
Device Description
The Indigo® OPTIMA Laser System consists of a treatment diode laser, fiberoptic
energy delivery devices, a footswitch, and an optional cart with printer. The treatment
laser allows delivery of controlled doses of laser energy in wavelengths between 800 and
850 nanometers (nm), When used with the OPTIMA Diffuser-Tip Fiberoptic, this laser
energy is diffused radially at 360° to the affected tissue to provide interstitial
thermotherapy (ITT), or interstitial laser coagulation (ILC). The fiberoptics (fibers) are
designed to be sterile, single patient use, disposable devices.
Modifications to design of the Diffuser-Tip Fiberoptic have been made to improve
manufacturability. Changes include removal of the inner sleeve, use of a new non
patient-contacting adhesive, and a software modification.
Intended Use
The Indigo OPTIMA Laser System when used with the Diffuser-Tip Fiberoptic is intended
for the safe and effective treatment of symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).
Comparison of Technological Characteristics
The technological features of the modified Diffuser-Tip Fiberoptic are the same as the
predicate with exception of the above design changes. The operating parameters of the
laser have been adjusted slightly to accommodate the design changes with no loss in
performance. No new issues of safety and effectiveness have been raised by these
modifications.
Performance Data
Design verification and validation testing confirms the modified Diffuser-Tip Fiberoptic
performs as intended and is equivalent to the predicate.

Dear Ms. Sprinkle:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for
use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce
prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good
manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class IIT (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be
found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish
further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean

any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with
all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807);
labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality
systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation
control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
