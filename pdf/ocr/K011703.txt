Vv. Rationale for Substantial Equivalence
The Modified Lumenis VersaPulse PowerSuite Holmium (Ho:YAG) and Dual
Wavelength (Ho:YAG/Nd:YAG) Surgical Lasers and Delivery Devices with
Accessories share the same intended use, indications for use, similar design
features, functional features, and therefore are substantially equivalent to the
VersaPulse PowerSuite Holmium (Ho:YAG) and Dual Wavelength
(Ho:YAG/Nd:YAG) Surgical Lasers and Delivery Devices with Accessories.
In addition, the Modified Lumenis VersaPulse PowerSuite Holmium (Ho:YAG)
and Dual Wavelength (Ho:YAG/Nd:YAG) Surgical Lasers are substantially
equivalent in terms of indications for use to the Trimedyne Holmium Laser
Systems (model 1210, model 1010-VHP, and model 1500-A) (002308), the
Dornier Medilas H/2 Laser System (K984591) and the Convergent Odyssey 30
Laser System (K951910).

VII. Safety and Effectiveness Information
Safety and effectiveness information was provided to demonstrate that the
Modified Lumenis VersaPulse PowerSuite Holmium (Ho:YAG) and Dual
Wavelength (Ho:YAG/Nd:YAG) Surgical Lasers and Delivery Devices with
Accessories are safe and effective, when indicated for use for general and specific
applications in the medical specialties of urology; urinary lithotripsy;
arthroscopy; discectomy; E.N.T. surgery; gynecological surgery; pulmonary :
surgery, gastroenterology surgery, dermatology and plastic surgery and general
surgery; for Ho:YAG and urology; general surgery; gastroenterology; thoracic
and pulmonary surgery; E.N.T. surgery; podiatry; orthopaedics; and with limited
indications in gynecology; neurosurgery; ophthalmology; and lumbar :
discectomy for Nd:YAG.

VII. Conclusion
The Modified Lumenis VersaPulse PowerSuite Holmium (Ho:YAG) and Dual
Wavelength (Ho:YAG/Nd:YAG) Surgical Lasers and Delivery Devices with
Accessories were found to be substantially equivalent to similar currently
marketed and predicate surgical lasers, delivery devices and accessories.
The Modified Lumenis VersaPulse PowerSuite Holmium (Ho:YAG) and Dual
Wavelength (Ho:YAG/Nd:YAG) Surgical Lasers and Delivery Devices with
Accessories share the same intended use, indications for use, similar design
features, and similar functional features as the currently marketed VersaPulse
PowerSuite Holmium (Ho:YAG) and Dual Wavelength (Ho:YAG/Nd:YAG)
Surgical Lasers and Delivery Devices with Accessories. The Modified Lumenis
VersaPulse PowerSuite Holmium (Ho:YAG) and Dual Wavelength
(Ho:YAG/Nd:YAG) Surgical Lasers and Delivery Devices with Accessories is
also substantially equivalent in terms of indications for use to the Trimedyne
Holmium Laser Systems (model 1210, model 1010-VHP, and model 1500-A)
(K002308), the Dornier Medilas H/2 Laser System (K984591) and the Convergent

Dear Ms. McGrath:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) notification of intent to market the device referenced
above and we have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use
stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce
prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act (Act). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls
provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual
registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against
misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class I] (Special Controls) or class III
(Premarket Approval), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations
_ affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 895.
A substantially equivalent determination assumes compliance with the Current Good
Manufacturing Practice requirements, as set forth in the Quality System Regulation (QS) for
Medical Devices: General regulation (21 CFR Part 820) and that, through periodic QS
inspections, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will verify such assumptions. Failure to
comply with the GMP regulation may result in regulatory action. In addition, FDA may publish
further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register. Please note: this
response to your premarket notification submission does not affect any obligation you might
have under sections 531 through 542 of the Act for devices under the Electronic Product
Radiation Control provisions, or other Federal laws or regulations.

Page 2 - Ms. Lisa G. McGrath /
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your 510(k) premarket
notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally marketed
predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device to
proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CER Part 801 and
additionally 809.10 for in vitro diagnostic devices), please contact the Office of Compliance at
(301) 594-4659. Additionally, for questions on the promotion and advertising of your device,
