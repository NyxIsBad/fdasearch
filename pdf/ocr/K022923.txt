V. Intended Use
The GentleYAG Laser is intended for use in the treatment of :

e Benign pigmented lesions such as, but not limited to, lentigos (age spots), solar
lentigos (sun spots), cafe au lait macules, seborrheic keratoses, nevi, chloasma,
verrucae, skin tags, keratoses, tattoos (significant reduction in the intensity of
black and/or blue black tattoos) and plaques.

e Pigmented lesions to reduce lesion size, for patients with lesions that would
potentially benefit from aggressive treatment, and for patients with lesions that
have not responded to other laser treatments.

e Reduction of red pigmentation in hypertrophic and keloid scars where
vascularity is an integral part of the scar.

e Removal of unwanted hair in skin types I to VI

¢ Photocoagulation and hemostasis of pigmented and vascular lesions

e Coagulation and hemostasis of soft tissue.

VI. Rationale for Substantial Equivalence
The Candela GentleYag Laser shares the same indications for use, matches key design
aspects, including spot size, similar wavelength and/or the same maximum delivered
power as the predicate devices, and therefore are substantially equivalent to the currently
marketed Candela Long Pulse Nd: YAG Laser System (K010104) and the Altus Family
of Cool Glide Lasers (K014040).
VII. Safety and Effectiveness Information
The new indications for use are based on the indications for use for the predicate laser
systems.
Technologically, the Candela GentleY AG Laser is identical to the previous predicate
Candela Long Pulse Nd: YAG Laser (K010104), therefore the risks and benefits for the
GentleYAG Laser are comparable to this predicate device.
We therefore believe that there are no new questions of safety or effectiveness raised by
the introduction of the device.
VIIL Conclusion
Candela believes that the GentleYAG Laser System is substantially equivalent to the
predicate devices based on operating principles, materials, mechanism of action, design,
construction, methods of assembly and intended uses.

Dear Ms. Nelson:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for
use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce
prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good
manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class IIE (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determimation does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by otherFederal agencies. You must comply
with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part
807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the

quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product
radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Additionally, for questions on the promotion
and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4639. Also,
