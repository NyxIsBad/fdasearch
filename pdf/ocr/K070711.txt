D. Device Name
Trade Name: InCircle™ Bi-Polar RF Ablation System
Classification Name: Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation device and

accessories

E. Performance Standards
The RFA Medical InCircle™ Bi-Polar RF Ablation Device has been
designed to comply with the applicable sections of ANSI/AAMI American
Standard for Electrosurgical Devices HF-18:2001 and the International
Electrotechnical Commission Standard for Electrosurgical Devices IEC
60601 -2-2:2006.

F. Device Description
The RFA Medical InCircle™ Bi-Polar RF Ablation System is a sterile,
disposable, bi-polar, Radio Frequency (RF), hand-held electrosurgical
device that utilizes opposing sets of Electrodes to coagulate/ablate a
region of soft tissue using bi-polar RF energy. The device is designed for
use in percutaneous, laparoscopic, and __ intraoperative surgical
procedures. The device is designed for use with standard FDA cleared
RF generators, such as the Boston Scientific Corporation
(RadioTherapeutics) RF3000 (K000241) and the RITA Medical Systems
1500X (K983214).

G. Intended Use
The RFA Medical InCircle™ Bi-Polar RF Ablation System is intended to be
used in conjunction with radiofrequency (RF) generators for the thermal
coagulation of soft tissues.

H. Substantial Equivalence
The RFA Medical InCircle™ Bi-Polar RF Ablation System is substantially
equivalent to the Boston Scientific Concerto™ Bipolar Needle Electrode
(K040785, K050361, and K060419) and Rita Medical Systems StarBurst™
Xli Electrosurgical Device (KO10060). The inCircle has a similar intended
use, materials of construction, and principles of operation as the predicate
devices. Both the subject and predicate devices are designed to
coagulate/ablate tissue by delivering RF energy with the use of electrodes.

I. Summary of Data
Bench testing/functional testing was performed on the RFA Medical
InCircle™ Bi-Polar RF Ablation System to ensure that the product is
substantially equivalent to the predicate device and to ensure that the new
device does not raise new questions of safety and efficacy.

Dear Ms. Murphy:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class I (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
