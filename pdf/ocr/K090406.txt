Indications for Use
510(k) Number (if known): K090406 |

Device Name: TEOQAE25, EP15 or EP25, or the combination of systems

Indications For Use:

The Interacoustics EP systems, EP15 and EP25, are intended to assist in the evaluation,
documentation and diagnosis of ear disorders on human beings. EP15/25 is a 2 channel ABR and the
automatic recording of ABR waveforms makes it well suited for waveform based screening and the
manual programmability options allow for comprehensive clinical use ranging from frequency specific

‘, threshold test to operating room applications and cochlear implant tests. The EP15 is a basic unit

~ allowing only recording of the Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR), while the EP25 allows recording of
the ABR and earlier and later potentials.

The Interacoustics TEOAE25 system is intended for determining Cochlear function using
Transient Evoked Otoaccoustic Emission click stimuli.

‘Both of these systems are of particular interest to Ear, Nose, and Throat doctors,

Neurology specialties, Audiologist and other health professionals concerned with
measuring auditory functions.
