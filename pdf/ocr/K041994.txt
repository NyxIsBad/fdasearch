Intended Use / Indications for Use
The MultiClearXL Multiwavelength Targeted Phototherapy System
(MultiClearXL’) is intended to provide phototherapeutic light to the body.
The MultiClearXL is generally indicated to treat dermatological conditions.
The MultiClearXL’s specific indication is for use in UVB phototherapy and
PUVA photochemistry to treat psoriasis, vitiligo, atopic dermatitis, and
leukoderma and for the use of visible blue/violet light to treat moderate
inflammatory acne vulgaris.
Technological Characteristics
The MultiClearXL is a computer controlled, high-intensity lamp
intended for treatment of dermatological disorders by emitting a homogenous
UV light dose in the UVB, UVA, and visible blue/violet light ranges. The
desired dose of UVA or UVB or blue/violet light is selected using controls on
the system front panel. The system consists of a console trolley, control
console, illumination assembly, an extension arm (light guide and hand
piece) and protective eyewear for the operator and patient.
Substantial Equivalence .
The MultiClearXL has the same intended use and indications and
similar principles of operation and technological characteristics as a
combination of the predicate devices. The MultiClearXL’s specific indications

E64 (999
are specific indications for at least one of the predicate devices. Any minor
differences between the MultiClearXL and its predicate devices raise no new
issues of safety or effectiveness. Thus, the MultiClearXL is substantially
equivalent to the predicate devices.

Dear Mr. Kahan:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
