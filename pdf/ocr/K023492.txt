Common/Usual Name: Electrosurgical Instruments
Classification Name: Electrosurgical Cutting and Coagulation Device And Accessories

(21 CFR 878.4400)
Proprietary Name: Everest Bipolar Cutting Forceps and Gyrus Bipolar Cutting Forceps
This device is a Class II medical device. The Bipolar Cutting Forceps is a modification to the
predicate devices cleared under K904993. The Bipolar Cutting Forceps is similar in construction
(with the exception of shaft length) and in component materials when compared to the predicate
device. The forceps jaws are electrically isolated from each other enabling one jaw to act as a
return electrode, eliminating the need for a return pad. To transect tissue a cutting blade is actuated
and moves between the electrode jaws. The modification has not altered the fundamental
technology of the predicate devices. The intended use, electrosurgical coagulation, grasping,
dissection and mechanical cutting of tissue during surgical procedures is identical to the predicate
devices cleared under K904993. The energy source, bipolar electrosurgical energy, is the same
energy type as used for the predicate devices.
In conclusion, as the design, materials of construction, function and intended use of the modified
bipolar cutting forceps is similar to that of the predicate devices currently cleared, Gyrus Medical
Inc. believes that no new issues of safety and effectiveness are raised and that the submitted device
is substantially equivalent.
