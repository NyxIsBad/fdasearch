4. Device Description
The purpose of this Special 510(k) is to notify FDA of the proposed inclusion of
the Diomed Delta 25 Laser into Diomed’s range of laser platforms. :
The Diomed Delta 25 Laser consists of a Class IV InGaAs/AlGaAs laser diode
with a wavelength of 1064nm + 20 nm and a visible laser (aiming beam) of 5
milliwatt Class IIa diode laser with a wavelength of 635 — 655 nm.
|
The Diomed Delta 25 Laser is made up of a treatment laser and aiming beam. The
Diomed Delta 25 is a diode laser capable of delivering up to 25 W of continuous
wave or pulsed radiation via an optical fiber coupled to the laser aperture.
Drawings and photographs of the Diomed Delta 25 Laser are included in the |
operator manual found in Appendix G. |
|
5. Indications for Use
The Diomed Delta 25 Laser is intended for use in delivering up to 25 Watts of
continuous wave or pulsed radiation to a flexible optical fiber for use in ablation,
incision, excision, coagulation and vaporisation of soft tissues in open and |
endoscopic surgical procedures.
6. Performance Data
The Diomed Delta 25 laser has undergone a comprehensive series of test
protocols in order to qualify and validate the performance of the device. The |
results of the qualification/validation demonstrates equivalent performance to the |
predicate devices which themselves have substantial clinical and market evidence |
of acceptable performance. The Diomed Delta 25 is therefore validated for use on ,
this basis.

Dear Mr. Phipps:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for
use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce
prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good
manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class Il (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
"or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply
with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part
807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the

quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product
radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other
general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
(240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address http://(www.fda.gov/cdrh/industry/support/index.html.
