Dear Mr. Trondle:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device

prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good
manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class I] (Special Controls) or class I] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be
found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish
further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or
any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with
all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807);

systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation
control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
