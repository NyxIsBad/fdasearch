Predicate Devices
ClearLight Phototherapy System, Model CT 420
Intended Use / Indications for Use
, The Radiancy Acne System with ClearTouch™ Light Unit Assembly
(“Radiancy Acne System”) is intended to provide phototherapeutic light to the
body. The Radiancy Acne System is generally indicated to treat
dermatological conditions. The Radiancy Acne System is specifically
indicated to treat mild and moderate inflammatory acne which includes
treatment of pustular inflammatory acne in patients with Fitzpatrick skin
types I-IV.
Technological Characteristics
The ClearTouch LUA is mounted on the hand piece of Radiancy’s
SpaTouch Photoepilation System (the “SpaTouch”), or on the hair removal /
acne hand piece of Radiancy’s SkinStation (the “SkinStation”), in order to
treat inflammatory acne (the “Radiancy Acne System”). The Radiancy Acne
System consists of two green-coated flash lamps. The Radiancy Acne System
produces a wavelength spectrum of 430 — 1100 nm with a pulse duration of 35
msec and has a spot size of 22 x 55 mm.
Substantial Equivalence
The Radiancy Acne System has the same intended use and very similar
indications for use, principles of operation, and technological characteristics
as the ClearLight Phototherapy System, Model CL 420 (“ClearLight System”).
The minor differences between the Radiancy Acne System and the ClearLight
System do not raise any new issues of safety and effectiveness. Clinical data
demonstrates that the Radiancy Acne System treats mild and moderate
inflammatory acne which include pustular inflammatory acne in patients
with Fitzpatrick skin types I-IV. Thus, the Radiancy Acne System is
substantially equivalent.
