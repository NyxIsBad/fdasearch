Koass¢eb

General Trade Name: MR Compatible Model 90 Electrosurgical Probe

Provisions Common/Classification Name: Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation accessory

Name of RITA Medical Systems Inc. - Model 90 Electrosurgical Probe

Predicate
Radiotherapeutics Corp. - MR Compatible LeVeen Needle Electrode

Classification Class I

Performance Performance standards have not been established by the FDA under section 514 of

Standards the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.

Intended Use The MR Compatible Model 90 Electrosurgical Probe is designed to supply energy
(generated by the RITA Medical Systems’ Electrosurgical Generator) for use in
electrosurgery and is designed for the following:

e Incorporation of multiple needles on each probe minimizing the number of
invasive accesses necessary to achieve desired lesions.

e Provide a minimally invasive laparoscopic, percutaneous, or intraoperative
access to the targeted tissue.

e Deliver radiofrequency energy in a controlled fashion to create coagulative
necrotic lesions.

e Incorporate thermocouples for temperature feedback.

e Provide for local delivery of fluid.

Device This RITA® MR Compatible Model 90 device is available in 15 cm and 25 cm

Description lengths for a variety of medical applications. The secondary electrodes deploy
out from the trocar tip. The RITA MR Compatible Model 90 device consists of
the following components:

e primary electrode: hypodermic tubing with a portion exposed as an
electrode
e secondary electrodes: extendible flexible hypodermic tubing at the distal
end of probe
e trocar insulation: shrink tubing
e handle: polymer materials with markings to indicate the amount of
electrode array deployment from the trocar
e = RF pathway: connection through a Lemo connector built into the handle
e fluid infusion: delivery through Luer port at side of the handle
© temperature sensors: five temperature sensors at the periphery of the array
e = depth indicators: Incremental 1-cm marks denote needle penetration depth.
Performance _ The MR Compatible Model 90 devices were subjected to a battery of electrical,
Data mechanical, biocompatibility, and magnetic resonance testing to verify that the
devices met the specifications. The devices met the specifications and the materials
did not elicit toxicological responses.

Dear Ms. Frischmeyer:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for
use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce
prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good
manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class I] (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply
with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part
807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the

Page 2 — Ms. Karen Frischmeyer /
, “ -  quality-systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product.
radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
: This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k) :
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally:
: : marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device

to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please 4
contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Additionally, for questions on the promotion
