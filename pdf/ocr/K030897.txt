Intended Use / Indications for Use
The SkinStation is a pulsed light device intended for hair removal and for treatment of pigmented
and vascular lesions.
Technological Characteristics and Substantial Equivalence
The SkinStation is a pulsed light device intended for hair removal and treatment of pigmented
and vascular lesions. When operated in the hair removal mode, the Skin Station is identical to
the previously cleared SpaTouch, except that it is now housed with the SPR module for treating
pigmented and vascular lesions. When operated in the pigmented and vascular lesions mode
(i.e., using the SPR handpiece), the SkinStation has the same intended use, with similar
indications for use, and is technologically similar to the cleared Quantum, with a few exceptions
which do not raise new issues of safety and effectiveness. In addition, the SkinStation has the
same intended use, with similar indications for use, and is technologically similar to the
previously cleared MBC’s Prolite and Palomar’s EsteLux when operated in the SPR mode

Dear Mr. Kahan:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration. ,
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 - Jonathan S. Kahan, Esq. :
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.

contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Additionally, for questions on the
promotion and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 5944639. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket
