Ceramic Tip for Monopolar Electrodes — Premarket Notification ‘PAJUNK::
Submission Nene rears ec
MEDIZINTECHNOLOGIE
Device Description:
The Pajunk ceramic tip electrodes are multiple uses, non-sterile delivered and latex free medical
devices. They are intended for transient delivery of energy required for coagulation of tissue.
The Pajunk MIC-System contains but is not limited to HF-electrodes for comfortable and safe
coagulation. Pajunk provides electrodes with and without suction and irrigation element and
electrodes with suction and irrigation capacity with retractable/ extendable tips. Isolation at tip is
made by ceramic.
The Modular system for optional monopolar coagulation enables a surgeon to manipulate,
dissect, retrieve, biopsy, cut or coagulate internal tissue or organs while performing laparoscopic
procedures. The instruments are insulated for optional monopolar coagulation.
The electrode-tips are retractable for comfortable suction and irrigation performance.
The Pajunk ceramic tip electrodes are intended for transient delivery of energy required for
coagulation of tissue. Ceramic tip electrodes are used during minimal invasive surgery,
according to the professional surgeon and the instructions for use. The ceramic tip electrodes
consist of a medical grade steel tube, ceramic tip and stainless steel electrode tip.
Technology Characteristics:
Pajunk’s monopolar ceramic tip electrodes have the same technological characteristics as the
predicate device identified below.
Pajunk’s monopolar ceramic tip electrodes are substantially equivalent to Pajunk’s monopolar
electrodes marketed under 510(k) number K033249. All materials, dimensions and intended use
are identical. There is one exception, which is the electrical insulation at the electrode tip. The
polyamide (Nylon) coating is substituted by a ceramic tip.
Pajunk’s monopolar ceramic tip electrodes are equivalent in design, physical dimensions,
ceramic, metal and plastics materials, to Aesculap’s monopolar ceramic tip electrodes marketed
under 510(k) number K970541.
There is one design difference: Aesculap’s monopolar ceramic tips can be unlocked from the
electrode shaft. Pajunk's monopolar ceramic tips are fixed to the electrode shaft and can not be
removed, nor lost during a surgical procedure.
Biocompatibility testing of Pajunk’s monopolar ceramic tip electrodes is located in Section 7 of
this submission.
Conclusion:
The comparison between the predicate device and the proposed device demonstrates that the
proposed device is safe and effective, as well as substantially equivalent to the predicate device.

Dear Mr. Quass:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
. adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2-1. A. Christian Quass
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
(301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address http:/Awww.fda.gov/cdrh/industry/support/ index.html.
