Predicate Device: Guidant FLEX 10 Probe Accessory,
(K013946), Reg. No. 878.4400; Product Code: NYE
Predicate Device Intended Use: The FLEX 10 Accessory is
indicated for surgical ablation of soft tissue, in addition to striated,
cardiac and smooth muscle by induction of thermal necrosis in the
targeted tissue. The system is a device indicated for use under
direct visualization, in surgical procedures, including minimally
invasive cardiac surgery procedures. The probes ablate the target
tissue by creating an inflammatory response, or thermal necrosis.
Device Description: The Medtronic Cardioblate® Gemini™ Surgical Ablation Device
is a hand held, bipolar radiofrequency ablation device intended to
ablate soft tissue during general surgery. It has a saline irrigation
system to deliver fluid at the contact point between the tissue and
electrode to cool the tissue during radiofrequency energy delivery.
Two unique jaw curvatures are provided: a standard curve (Model
49260) and extra curve (Model 49261). This device is intended for
intermittent operation. Sterile, Nonpyrogenic, Disposable, Single
use only.
intended Use: The Cardioblate Gemini Surgical Ablation Device is intended to
ablate soft tissue during general surgery using radiofrequency
energy. The system is indicated for use under direct or endoscopic
visualization, in surgical procedures, including minimally invasive
surgical procedures.
Contraindications: | The Cardioblate® Surgical Ablation System is contraindicated for
patients that have active endocarditis at the time of surgery.
Ablation in a pool of blood (eg, through a purse string suture on a
beating heart). Effects of this type of ablation have not been
studied.
HI.SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE TESTING SUMMARY
The Cardioblate® Gemini™ Surgical Ablation Device has demonstrated substantial
equivalence to the predicate devices based on the indications for use, basic overall
function and performance characteristics. The Cardioblate® Gemini™ Surgical Ablation
Device has been tested and is considered safe and effective per the following recognized
consensus standard AAMI/ANSI HF 18:2001, Electrosurgical Devices, IEC 60601-1, and IEC
60601-2-2.

Dear Mr. Job:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for
use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce
prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may, ’
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good
manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controis) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply
with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part
807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the
quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product
radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
