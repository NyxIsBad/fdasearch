Intended Uses -eoee eo (2 Q 4h )
The Gyrus ACMI General Surgery Workstation is indicated for ablation, resection,
and coagulation of soft tissue and hemostasis of blood vessels in surgery.
These devices are marketed as reusable devices; methods for cleaning, disinfecting
and sterilization are included in latter sections of this submission under Section 12.0,
“Cleaning”.
Product Description
The currently marketed Gyrus ACMI General Surgery Workstation is a bipolar RF
generator that accepts a variety of disposable hand pieces that utilize a PlasmaKinetic
(PK) or PlasmaCision (PC) waveform. The generator face includes two sockets that
allow a range of hand pieces to be utilized in a dry field environment, although only
one socket may be active at any given time.
The Gyrus ACMI General Surgery Workstation General Purpose Electrosurgical
Generator employs a system of automatic instrument detection, through a resistor
located in the hand piece connector plug. This ensures that only the allowable range
of waveform output and power level can only be applied to the instrument
irrespective of the output socket. Accessories presently provided with the Gyrus
ACMI General Surgery Workstation include a power cable and a foot switch. It
should be noted that this footswitch is also used with the Gyrus ACMI SuperPulse
generator (cleared under K031085).
This Special 510(k) proposes the addition of a new optional accessory, the Dual
Footswitch Connector Cable. The Dual Footswitch Connector Cable allows for easier
use of the Gyrus ACMI General Surgery Workstation when multiple surgeons are
present. This is achieved by allowing the connection and use of two footswitches on
the same generator. The indications for use, principles of operation, energy waveform
outputs, and accessories of the Gyrus ACMI General Surgery Workstation with the
Dual Footswitch Connector Cable accessory remain the same as the currently
marketed Gyrus ACMI General Surgery Workstation.
Summary of Safety and Effectiveness
The proposed modifications for the Gyrus ACMI General Surgery Workstation, as
described in this submission, are substantially equivalent to the predicate device. The
proposed addition of the Dual Footswitch Connector Cable as an accessory is not a
substantial change or modification, and do not significantly affect the safety or
efficacy of the devices.
