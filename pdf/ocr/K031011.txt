2. Name of Device
Trade or Proprietary Name: LigaSure™ 5mm Laparoscopic Sealer-Divider
Common Name: Bipolar Laparoscopic Electrosurgical Instrument
Classification Name:

e Electrosurgical Cutting and Coagulation Device and Accessories, and
e Gynecologic Electrocautery and Accessories

3. Predicate Devices
The Valleylab LigaSure™ 5mm Laparoscopic Sealer-Divider is substantially
equivalent to the Valleylab LS1000 LigaSure™ LAP Laparoscopic Instrument
(K981916), and the Valleylab LS1100 LigaSure ATLAS™ Laparoscopic SealerDivider Instrument (K010013). All three of these devices are used in
laparoscopic surgery to seal vessels by the application of RF energy to the
vessels and tissues interposed between the jaws of the instrument. The
LigaSure™ 5mm Laparoscopic Sealer-Divider and the LS1100 LigaSure
ATLAS™ Laparoscopic Sealer-Divider Instrument divide tissue using a surgeonactuated blade.

4. Device Description

The LigaSure 5mm Laparoscopic Sealer-Divider is a multi-functional
electrosurgical instrument for use with the LigaSure Vessel Sealing Generator
(K981916) when performing laparoscopic surgery. The instrument is capable of
sealing vessels, dividing vessels and tissue clamped between its jaws, grasping
tissue, and blunt dissection. The outer diameter of the instrument shaft is 5mm,

with a working length of 37 cm. Controls are located on the instrument handle.
All controls can be operated with either the right or left hand.
The instrument attaches to the generator with a “smart” connector that identifies
the instrument type to the LigaSure generator, and a ten (10) foot cable. The
instrument is supplied sterile for single-use.

5. Intended Use
The LigaSure™ 5mm Vessel Sealer-Divider is a bipolar electrosurgical
instrument intended for use with the LigaSure Generator in general and
gynecologic laparoscopic surgical procedures where ligation and division of
vessels is desired. The instrument creates a seal by the application of RF
electrosurgical energy to vascular structures (vessels) interposed between the
jaws of the instrument. A blade within the instrument is actuated to divide tissue.
Indications for use include general laparoscopic surgical procedures including
urologic, vascular, thoracic and thoracoscopic, and gynecologic laparoscopic
procedures where ligation and division of vessels is performed. These
procedures include: laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy, Nissen
fundoplication, colectomy, adhesiolysis, oophorectomy, etc. The LigaSure 5mm
Vessel Sealer-Divider has not been shown to be effective for tubal sterilization or
tubal coagulation for sterilization procedures, and should not be used for these
procedures.
The LigaSure 5mm Vessel Sealer-Divider can be used on vessels up to and
including 7mm diameter, and tissue bundles as large as will fit in the jaws of the
instrument.

6. Summary of Technological Characteristics
The LigaSure™ 5mm Laparoscopic Sealer-Divider has the same basic
technological characteristics as the predicate devices noted above.

7. Performance Data
Performance testing and pre-clinical studies were performed to ensure that the
LigaSure™ 5mm Laparoscopic Sealer-Divider functions as intended, and meets
design specifications. Sufficient data were obtained to show that the device is
substantially equivalent to the predicate devices, and meets safety and
effectiveness criteria.
