C. Device Name
Trade Name: DYONICS EletroBlade Resector
Common Name: Arthroscopic Surgery Blade / Electrosurgical Probe
Classification Name: Electrosurgical Probe
D. Predicate Devices
DYONICS ElectroBlade (K994365)
E. Description of Device
The DYONICS ElectroBlade Resector combines the rotary cutting technology of
Dyonics Arthroscopic Surgery Blades with the electrosurgical capabilities of a
Re bipolar electrosurgery probe. The inner rotational blade is electrified by connection
to a standard generator. Insulation on the outer blade isolates the electrical energy to
the inner tube where it is exposed to tissue at the cutting window of the blade. The
DYONICS ElectroBlade Resector operates in conjunction with the standard Dyonics
shaver system and standard electrosurgical generator systems.
D. Intended Use
The DYONICS Electroblade Resector is indicated for use in arthroscopic surgical
procedures of large and small articular cavities. The DYONICS Electroblade
Resector is effective in soft and osseous tissue resection and in hemostasis of
bleeding vessels. It is intended for arthroscopic procedures using saline solution,
Ringer’s lactate or other conductive solutions as an irrigant under direct or video
assisted fiberoptic visualization.

E. Comparison of Technological Characteristics
_The DYONICS Electroblade Resector is a combination of both bipolar RF and
mechanical resector technologies. The design reflects this combination of these
technologies. The resection and coagulation capabilities are features that are also
found in the DYONICS Electroblade. The modified DYONICS Electroblade
Resector is substantially equivalent to the DYONICS Electroblade in intended use,
materials and method of operation.

Dear Mr. Crabtree:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class H (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean

or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
