2. Device &
Classification Name: Laser Handpiece Accessory System (Class 2), Product Code GEX,
21 CFR 878.4810 - Tradename of device: Serenity Pro PSF™ System
3 Predicate Devices: Inolase Serenity PSF™ (Pneumatic Skin Flattening) Systems (KO71469), (K071943}
, & (K062589)

4. Description: The Serenity Pro PSF™ System is a device which has the ability to produce a
vacuum at a level of 380-680 mbar. Suction can be delivered through its handpiece,
which has a sapphire window at its distal end, to be positioned over the skin for laser
or IPL treatment. When the PSF system is activated, the negative pressure results in
the flattening of the skin of the treatment site. During the time duration of suction, the
treatment beam of the laser or IPL is administered through the sapphire window of
the handpiece, which is transparent and thermally conductive. The resultant tight
mechanical contact produced by the PSF expels blood from the treatment site which
enhances the light penetration of the laser or IPL in tissue as well as the removal of
its heat from the skin. This can reduce the possibility of post treatment erythema.
The Candela-Inolase Serenity Pro PSF™ (Pneumatic Skin Flattening) System is

5. intended Use: indicated for the following uses:

As an accessory for a compatible legally marketed Laser or Intense Pulse Light
System for use in hair removal. Its handpiece produces a negative pressure over the
skin surface, just prior to the administration treatment beam through it.
Reduction of pain during Laser or Intense Pulse Light System treatment.
6. Comparison of

Technological With respect to technology, the Serenity Pro PSF™ System is substantially

Characteristics: equivalent to its predicate device. No changes have been made to the technology.
The purpose of the 510(k) was to expand its indications for use for the device.

510(k) Summary

7. Performance Data: The basis for substantial equivalence for this device (K072925) relies upon the
clinical data which was submitted in KO071469. K071469 was determined to be
substantially equivalent by FDA on 8/15/2007.
This data was obtained in a clinical study. The primary objective of the study
was to confirm the assumption that the Candela - Inolase Serenity PSF™
(Pneumatic Skin Flattening) System (PSF) reduces laser therapy associated
pain. This study involved normal laser treatment parameters which were
typically expected to be painful. Evaluation consisted of pain experienced in
treated sites with PSF compared with treated sites without PSF. The
measurement of immediate post treatment subject pain was recorded utilizing
a modified McGill Pain questionnaire, which is commonly used in pain
evaluation.
A secondary objective of this clinical study was to confirm that the use of PSF
decreased the erythema associated with current laser therapy. The clinical
investigators rated erythema immediately and 20 minutes post treatment for
standard laser treatment laser vs. laser with PSF.
The results of the clinical data indicated that the Candela - Inolase Serenity
PSF™ (Pneumatic Skin Flattening) System (PSF) significantly reduces the pain
associated with laser hair removal and that the side effect of erythema was
lessened with PSF vs. without PSF standard laser treatment.
In terms of fundamental technology and intended use, the device (K071469),
which was utilized in the clinical study, is essentially the same as the device
(K072925), which is subject of this 510(k) submission. Therefore, this clinical
study is relevant to this 510(k} submission and, Candela - Inolase has
concluded that no new safety or efficacy issues have been raised.

Received: October 24, 2007
Dear Mr. Hattub:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class IH (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21

Page 2 — Mr. George J. Hattub
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance
