Predicate Devices
Neothermia Corp.’s en-bloc Biopsy System™ (K003190) and the 20mm Auto Suture ABBI
Breast Biopsy System (K983296).
Intended Use
The en-bloc Biopsy System is intended for diagnostic sampling of breast tissue during a
breast biopsy procedure.

Technological Characteristics
The en-bloc is a high frequency, vacuum-assisted electrosurgical device used to remove
tissue by electrosurgical cutting and simultaneous capture of an incised tissue volume.
The Neothermia en-bloc ™ consists of a hand-held biopsy handle, upon which the singleuse en-bloc Biopsy Probe is attached, with an integral cable to connect the handle to the
control unit. The Probe™ contains two sets of active electrodes at its distal end —a
precursor electrode and cutting/capture electrodes. The shaft of the Probe™ is encased in
a stainless steel cannula. An outer plastic sleeve surrounds this stainless steel cannula
and an annular gap between the sleeve and the cannula provides a conduit for vacuumassisted removal of the gaseous products of electrosurgical cutting and any liquids (e.g.,
blood) that may accumulate at the distal end of the Probe during the biopsy procedure.

Performance Data
Testing of the device was conducted on porcine tissue to evaluate the ability of the 20mm
probe to cut and capture a predictable volume of tissue and to assess its suitability for
post-biopsy pathology evaluation. It was determined that the 20mm probe is capable of
obtaining intact, unfragmented biopsy specimens having a predictable diameter and
length and suitable for post-biopsy histopathologic examination.

Substantial Equivalence
The Company’s en-bloc Biopsy System™ with a 20mm probe covered by this .
submission is substantially equivalent to its en-bloc Biopsy System™ with a 10mm
probe (K003190). Additionally, it is substantially equivalent to United States Surgical
Corp.’s 20mm Auto Suture (ABBI) Breast Biopsy System (K9963825).
The modified en-bloc Biopsy System™ with a 20mm probe is identical to the cleared enbloc Biopsy System™ with a 10mm_ probe except that the former is available with a
20mm disposable probe, as well as the cleared 10mm disposable probe. : t
With respect to the predicate device (en-bloc Biopsy System™ with a 10mm probe), the
en-bloc Biopsy System™ with a 20mm probe has the same intended use, principles of
operation, and technological characteristics.
With respect to the predicate device (20mm ABBI Breast Biopsy System), the en-bloc
Biopsy System™ with a 20mm probe has similar intended use, both devices remove
breast tissue for diagnostic biopsies. Both devices have similar principles of operation,
and similar technological characteristics. Both devices remove a 20mm specimen.
Although there are minor differences in the characteristics of the 20mm en-bloc Biopsy
System™ and its predicate devices, those differences do not raise new questions of safety
or efficacy.

Dear Ms. Coval-Goldsmith:
This letter corrects our substantially equivalent letter of March 27, 2002 regarding the product
code.
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent [(for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure)] to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act). You may,'therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls
provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual
registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against
misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class IJ (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be
found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

This letter will allow you to continue marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801 and
additionally Part 809.10 for in vitro diagnostic devices), please contact the Office of Compliance
at (301) 594-4659. Additionally, for questions on the promotion and advertising of your device,
please contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4639. Other general information on your
