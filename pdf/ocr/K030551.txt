Substantial Equivalence
This Special 510(k) proposes modifications in dimensional specifications, materials, and
labeling for the ArthroCare ArthroWands, which were previously cleared under K020557
on March 21, 2002. The indications for use, technology, principle of operation,
performance specifications, materials, and sterilization parameters of the ArthroWands
remain the same as in the predicate cleared 510(k).
Summary of Safety and Effectiveness
The modified ArthroWands, as described in this submission, are substantially equivalent
to the predicate ArthroWands. The proposed modification in dimensional specifications,
materials, and labeling are not substantial changes or modifications, and do not
significantly affect the safety or efficacy of the devices.

Dear Ms. Defiesta-Ng:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class Ul (Special Controls) or class HI (PMA). it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing

(21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). Other general
information on your responsibilities under the Act may be obtained from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
