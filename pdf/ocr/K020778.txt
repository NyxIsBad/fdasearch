Gyrus ENT L.L.C. 510(k) Premarket Notification
Bartlett, TN Gyrus ENT Somnoplasty® Model 2420 Tissue Coagulating Electrode
Description and Substantial Equivalence
The Somnoplasty® System is comprised of three principal elements: (1) the Model 2420
Disposable Tissue Coagulating Electrode; (2) the Model RC-20 Reusable Cable*; and (3)
the Modified Model S2 Electrosurgical Generator*, or another two-channel Gyrus
electrosurgical generator. Previous versions of the Somnoplasty® System have been
cleared for use in soft tissue coagulation in the uvula/soft palate (K971450), treatment of
nasal obstruction due to chronic turbinate hypertrophy (K973618), and reduction of the
incidence of airway obstructions in patients suffering from UARS or OSAS (K982717).
*In addition, the current Model S2 Generator was cleared for use in conjunction with
disposable soft tissue coagulation electrodes in K001438, and the RC-20 Cable was
cleared in K000720.
The Model 2420 Tissue Coagulating Electrode also is substantially the same as the
Model 1420 Electrode that was cleared in K000720. Thus, there are no significant
differences in design or technological features between the current Somnoplasty®
System and the company’s previously cleared products. A brief description of each of
the components of the current System is provided below.
The Model 2420 Tissue Coagulating Electrode is used to deliver RF energy for selective
thermal coagulation of tissue. The electrode is provided as a dual needle that is deployed
from a guide sleeve. The angle of deployment is fixed at approximately 45°. The needle
is covered proximally by insulation to protect the mucosa during coagulation. A beveled
penetrator plate is located at the tip of the guide sleeve and serves to penetrate the tonsil
mucosal surface prior to electrode deployment. Temperature sensors located at the tip of
the needle and the tip of the insulation monitor lesion temperature.
Like the previously cleared Model 1420 electrode, the Model 2420 provides a slide
actuator on the handle used to extend or retract the needle electrodes through attached
dual guide lumens. The proximal end of the handle accepts the detachable and reusable
power cable. The distal end of the handle is attached to the guide lumens containing the
needle electrodes. The entire device is disposable.
