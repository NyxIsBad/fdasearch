Dear Mr. Sivec:
This letter corrects our substantially equivalent letter of September 6, 2006.
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices,
good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be
found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Page 2- Mr. Klaus Sivec
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); medical device reporting (reporting of medical
device-related adverse events) (21 CFR 803); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
go to http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/CDRH/CDRHOffices/ucm115809.htm for
the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance. Also, please
note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part
807.97). For questions regarding the reporting of adverse events under the MDR regulation (21
CFR Part 803), please go to http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/mdr/ for the CDRH’s Office of
Surveillance and Biometrics/Division of Postmarket Surveillance.
You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the

Rationale for Substantial Equivalence
The INTERmedic Diode Laser Family including Accessories have
the same intended uses and indications for uses as the listed
predicate devices, and have similar technological characteristics
as the predicate devices — treatment wavelengths, laser media,
mode of operation, power output, exposure duration, treatment
intervals, laser energy delivery control and therefore is
substantially equivalent to the predicate devices.

Device Description
The INTERmedic Diode Laser Family is designed to deliver laser
power at wavelengths of 810nm and 980nm, depending on model,
that can be used for the procedures indicated in the section
“Indication for Use” in this summary. The ContrAge model can be
used with or without the RF unit. The different models can be
identified by their different names, output frequency and maximum
power.
Each system is comprised with the following main components:
- Operating software controlled by a microprocessor
- A footswitch (detachable)
- Alaser cabinet/console with fiber port
- Asafety Interlock

Technological Characteristics and Substantial Equivalence
From a clinical point of view and comparing design and
specifications, the INTERmedic Diode Laser Family and predicate
devices, Ceralas Laser Family from BioLitec, Laser Family from
Dornier, Syneron Laser Systems and other listed in predicate
devices are substantially equivalent. Based on the overall
performance and technological characteristics of the devices,
INTERmedic Arfran S.A. believes that no significant differences
exist between the INTERmedic Diode Laser Family and the
predicate devices. They all work in the same range of wavelength
and have the same indications for use.

Indications for use
The INTERmedic Diode Laser Family (and their delivery
accessories used to deliver optical, ultrasound and RF energy) are
indicated for use in surgical applications requiring the
vaporization, incision, excision, ablation, cutting and hemostasis,
or coagulation of soft tissue in conjunction with endoscopic
equipment for medical specialties including: Urology,
Genitourinary (Urology), Thoracic Surgery, Plastic Surgery and
Dermatology, Aesthetics including vascular lesions and hair
removal, General Surgery, Ophthalmology, Orthopedics, Podiatry,
Arthroscopy, Spinal Surgery, Gynecology, Pulmonary Surgery,
Neurosurgery, Gastroenterology, Head/Neck/ENT and Radiology,
Endovascular coagulation, Oral Surgery and Dental procedures. :
Examples include: (see page 5 in this Summary)

Safety and effectiveness
The INTERmedic Diode Laser Family is designed, manufactured
and tested according mandatory and voluntary international
Standards. Compared to the previously indicated predicate
devices, the introduction of the INTERmedic Diode Laser Family
provides no new clinical indications, which have previously
demonstrated clinical effectiveness.

The increase of power to 120W does not affect any safety and security characteristics. The 120W contains
additional diodes and has a shorter treatment time on the patient, compare to a 100W or a laser using less
wattage.
