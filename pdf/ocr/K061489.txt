Date of Summary: March 8, 2007 Classification Name: Laser Instrument,
Surgical Powered
Common Name: Surgical Laser Instrument Proprietary — Solar™ Surgical
Ablation System
Description of Device: The Solar™ Surgical Ablation System consists of a Laser Energy
Generator, a Reciprocator Control unit, a fluid delivery tubing set and a flexible surgical ablation
track. The Solar™ Orbital Track is an intraoperative, sterile, single-use device designed to apply
laser energy to tissue. The fluid delivery tubing set is a single-use device having a sterile fluid
path designed for the delivery of sterile saline solution to the ablation catheter. The Reciprocator
Control unit is a motion generating device housing the fluid delivery pump and provides the
means of monitoring the ablation process parameters. The laser energy Generator and
Reciprocator Control Unit are sold separately. The Solar™ Orbital Track includes a ridged
metallic shaft, a flexible track, and a guide lead and is equipped with a 905 SMA connector cable
which attaches to the laser energy generator output connector. The emitted laser energy is
directed toward the target tissue from the end of the optical fiber which rides within the flexible
track.
Statement of Intended Use: The Medical CV Solar™ Surgical Ablation System is indicated
for delivery of 810nm or 1064nm laser light to soft tissue, under direct visualization, during
surgical procedures. Indications include the ablation, or coagulation of soft tissue.

Warning: The Solar™ Surgical Ablation System is not indicated for the treatment of
cardiac arrhythmias.

The risk of actual damage to adjacent organs from the instrument exists and
perforation, rupture or tearing of tissue, may occur as a complication of laser use. Burns can
occur if the laser energy is not correctly applied. These complications may be serious.
Technological Comparison: The Solar™ Surgical Ablation System was compared to the
current Atrilaze™ Surgical Ablation System and Guidant’s FLEX10 Surgical Ablation System.
Both the currently available Atrilaze™ ablation probe and the Solar™ flexible Orbital Track are
provided sterile with a sterile, non-pyrogenic fluid path used for cooling of the optical fiber. Both
fiber optic delivery systems utilize the same laser energy generator and are connected via an
SMA 905 connector to deliver laser energy to the target tissue.

Both the Solar™ Surgical Ablation and the Guidant FLEX10 Surgical Ablation Systems employ
a flexible track/catheter and are positioned using existing endoscopic tools and techniques and are
monitored under direct visualization by the surgeon during use.

For purposes of this submission, the Solar™ Surgical Ablation System was compared to the
following predicate devices:

* Medical CV Atrilaze™ Surgical Ablation System (K040744, K052495 & K060680)

* Guidant’s Microwave FLEX10 Surgical Ablation System (K003978 & K013946)
Testing: The results of biocompatibility testing conducted on the disposable fiber optic
delivery system and tubing set support that the materials used in the manufacture of the
disposables are non-toxic, non-hemolytic, and non-pyrogenic. All biocompatibility testing was
conducted under Good Laboratory Practices per 21 CFR Part 58.

Performance testing for the Solar™ Surgical Ablation System included
compliance to manufacturing specifications for Power Output, Fluid Flow along with visual and
histology evaluation of the lesions obtained on cardiac tissue.

Testing demonstrated that adherence to specifications was demonstrated and the
lesions obtained using the Solar™ flexible Orbital Trac are substantially equivalent to those
obtained with the currently cleared Atrilaze™ Surgical Ablation System, which is to be expected
since the energy source, the optical fiber, and application method used in both systems are
identical.

Dear Mr. Steger:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for
use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce
prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good
manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply
with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part
807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the
quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product
radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 — Mr. Denny Steger /
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other
general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
