Common Name: Argon Plasma Coagulator (APC) Connector Hose and
Probes
Trade/Proprietary Name: ERBE APC Handle and Applicators
Classification Name: Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation device and
accessories (21CFR878.4400)
Product Code: 79GEl
Legally Marketed Device: Accessories (APC Connector Hose and Probes) submitted in
the ERBE APC 300 Argon Plasma Coagulator and
Accessories, 510(k) Number: K963189
Note: The APC Connector Hose and Probes being submitted in this premarket
notification are modified from the accessories in the above 510(k). The modifications
were determined to require a 510(k) submission.
Device Description:
The APC Connector Hose is a flexible connecting cable. It has a pronged connecting
end to the APC Probe and is 8.2ft. (2.5m) in length (Note: The other end of the hose
connects to an ERBE Argon Plasma Coagulator Model APC 300.). The connector ends
of the Hose are made of polyamide, poly ether ether ketone (PEEK), and plastic
(Thermoflex). The cable portion of the Hose is silicone. The Hose is a conduit for both
electrosurgical current and argon gas. The APC Connector Hose is provided non-sterile
and is reusable (Note: The cleaning and sterilization processes have been validated
and are provided in the Notes for use to the customer.).

510K SUMMARY

: The APC Probes are also tubular instruments and are flexible. They are provided in
various lengths and diameter sizes to accommodate the various size/types of ,
endoscopes for a variety of applications (i.¢., the treatment of various target tissues
inside a patient). The lengths of the APC Probes are 4.9ft. (1.5m) to 9.8ft. (3m). The
diameters of the APC Probes are 4.5 French (1.5mm) to 9.6 French (3.2mm). For the
Probe, the connector end is made of plastics (polypropylene and Thermoflex). The tube
portion of the Probe is made of Teflon (PTFE) and has a stainless steel wafer shape
electrode close to the tip for terminating electrical current. For the lateral opening (side
fire) Probe there is a glued on ceramic tip. The APC Probes have either an axial
(straight fire) or a lateral (side fire) opening allowing the energy to be delivered straight
or at a 45 to 90 degree angle. The two types of openings for the APC Probes allow the
physician a choice in the direction of delivering the argon plasma to the treatment site.
The APC Probes are provided sterile by means of ethylene oxide and are disposable
(Single Use) [Note: The sterilization cycle has been validated. See Section IV,
Sterilization information, !V-1 to IV-2).
The APC Connector Hose and Probes are accessories of the ERBE Argon Plasma
Coagulator Model APC 300 (Note: The Coagulator is used with an ERBOTOM ICC
Series Electrosurgical Generator Unit.). The APC Connector Hose attaches to gas as
well as electrical inputs of the Coagulator and then to an APC Probe (Note: The
Coagulator has an instrument recognition system which identifies the Probe for argon
gas flow purposes.). An endoscope is manipulated inside the patient to locate tissue
that requires treatment. Upon finding the target tissue, the APC Probe is threaded into
the working channel of the endoscope, until the tip of the APC Probe slightly protrudes
from the end of the scope. Then opening of the APC Probe is positioned towards/in
close proximity of the area to be treated ((Note: The APC Probes have depth marker
rings close to the tip for positioning purposes.). The APC/ICC system is activated via a
footswitch. When high frequency voltage reaches the critical level and the proximity to
tissue is close enough, electrically conductive argon plasma forms in the gas stream.
This allows the current to flow between the probe and the tissue. Current density upon
arrival at the tissue surface causes coagulation. The application of the energy to the
tissue is uniform and contact free.
Intended Use:
The APC Connector Hose and Probes are intended for use in argon plasma
coagulation. The device is used to treat many conditions in endoscopy for various
surgical procedures.
Similarities and Differences of the Modified Device to the Current Device (Predicate
Comparison/Substantial Equivalence):
APC Connector Hose

INl-2

510K SUMMARY

, Similarities
The modified Hose has the same performance specifications, intended use, packaging,
and labeling. Also like the predicate, it is provided non-sterile and is re-usable with the
same cleaning procedures.
Differences
For the modified Hose, the end that connects to the APC Filter/Coagulator (Model APC300) has a slightly smaller insert thread diameter (Note: Change is from 7.2mm to
6.8mm) in comparison to the predicate. This change was made to make the connection
to the APC Filter/Coagulator (Model APC-300) more secure/tighter. Also, the modified
Hose has a one piece y-connector where as the predicate’s is a two-piece v-connector
(Note: Change enhances integrity). The cable of the modified Hose is more flexible
then the cable of the predicate, making manipulation easier. In addition, the connector
end of the Hose that attaches to an APC Probe is made of a material (i.e., a plastic in
comparison to a polyamide) that is harder and has two pins instead of one in
comparison to the predicate (Note: The modified connection to the APC Probe is more

/ secure.).
All the changes have been verified or validated in design control.
Finally, a contract manufacturer will make the modified APC Connector Hose in
comparison to the predicate that is made in-house by ERBE Elektromedizin GmbH.
APC Probe ,
Similarities
The modified APC Probes have the same performance specifications, intended use,
and labeling. Dimensional and packaging specifications are very similar. Also like the
predicate, it is provided sterile by ethylene oxide and is single use.
Differences
For the modified APC Probes, the end that joins to the APC Connector Hose has a
receptacle for a two-prong attachment instead of one pin. Also the material of the
connector end is made of a plastic instead of nylon. The attachment end is hardier and
the connection to the APC Connector Hose is more secure with the two pins. One of
the APC Probes (P/N: 20132-100) is slightly longer than the longest predicate (P/N:
20132-166) [Note: Increase is from 2.5m/8.2ft. to 3m/9.8ft.] The 3m/9.8ft. Probe is for
use in an endoscope that has a longer channel. Also, the internal electrode that is close
to the tip was modified from a coiled wire to a solid wafer shaped piate. The electrode
ignites better and cools quicker because of the larger surface area in the modified APC
Probe (i.e., there is more consistency in activation). in addition, the ceramic tip has
been found not to be necessary for the straight fire Probes which helps reduce
agglutination at the tip.

IH-3

510K SUMMARY
The packaging specifications have slightly changed from the predicate device submitted , ,
in the 510(k). The package is shorter and wider (260 x 230mm in comparison to 400 x
205mm).
All the changes have been verified or validated in design control.
Finally, a contract manufacturer will manufacture the modified APC Probes in contrast
with the predicate devices, which are made in-house by ERBE Elektromedizin GmbH.
Conclusion:
The APC Connector Hose and Probes have the same intended use, principles of
operation, and technological characteristics as the accessories in the previously cleared
predicate device.
The dimensional or structural modification as well as the material change to the
connector ends of the APC Connector Hose does not adversely affect the safety or
effectiveness of the accessory. Also, the contract manufacturing of the APC Connector
Hose does not raise safety or efficacy concerns.
The structural modification to the connector end of the APC Probes, the material
changes in the APC Probes, as well as the redesigned internal electrode does not
/ adversely affect the safety or effectiveness of the accessories. Also, the one Probe
being longer and the packaging changes did not have a safety or efficacy impact.
In addition, the contract manufacturing of the APC Probes does not raise safety or
efficacy concerns.
