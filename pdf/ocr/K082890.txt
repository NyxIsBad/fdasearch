Dear Ms. Trujillo: :
This letter corrects our substantially equivalent letter of October 15, 2008
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the
device referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the
indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed
in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device
Amendments or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a
premarket approval (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general
controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include
requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice,
labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III .
(PMA), it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your
device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In
addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal /
Register.
