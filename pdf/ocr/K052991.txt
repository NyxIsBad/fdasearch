Device Description
The Radiancy Facial SkinCare Device is a pulsed-light, manually controlled system
designed to treat benign pigmented lesions.

Intended Use / Indications for Use
The Facial SkinCare Device is intended for use in dermatology. The Facial SkinCare
Device is specifically indicated to treat benign pigmented lesions, including, but not
limited to solar lentigines, ephilides (freckles), and mottled pigmentation in patients with
Fitzpatrick skin types I-V.

Technological Characteristics
The Facial SkinCare Device that is the subject of this 510(k) notice is similar to devices
already cleared to treat benign pigmented lesions.

Substantial Equivalence
The Radiancy Facial SkinCare Device has the same intended use and one of the same
indications for use, same principles of operation and same technological characteristics
as the Radiancy SPR System and the Ellipse 7PL™, which have already been cleared to
treat benign pigmented lesions. The minor differences between the Radiancy Facial
SkinCare Device and the predicates do not raise new issues of safety and effectiveness.
Thus, the Radiancy Facial SkinCare Device is substantially equivatent.

Dear Ms. Fourte:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA),
it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device
can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA
may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mcan
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)

device to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21 CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
