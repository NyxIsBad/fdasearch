4. Device Description
The Rhytec, Inc. Portrait PSR3 is an electro-surgical device for use in
dermatological applications. UHF energy from the generator converts Nitrogen
gas into plasma within the handpiece. The plasma emerges from the nozzle at the
distal end of the handpiece and is directed onto the skin to be treated. Rapid
heating of the skin occurs as the excited gas gives up energy to the skin. Through
the combination within the handpiece of precisely controlled energy and Nitrogen
gas, individual plasma pulses are produced that will give predictable tissue
effects.

Dear Ms. O’Connell:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for
use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce
prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good
manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be
found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish
further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or
any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with
all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807);
labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality
systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation
control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
