510(K) SUMMARY of SAFETY and EFFECTIVENESS
K0733 00
This summary of 5i0(k) safety and effectiveness information is being submitted in
accordance with the requirements of the Safe Medical Device Act (SMDA) of 1990
and 21 CFR §807.92.
The assigned 510(k) number is: .
1. Submitter's Identification:
Milesman, S.L.
Max Planck 545, P.I. Roces,
33211 Gijon, A
Asturias, Spain DEC 0 4 200?
Date Summary Prepared: August 15, 2007
2. Name of the Device:
Trade Name: Milesman Premium Pulsed Diode Array Laser System
Classification Name: Laser Instrument, Surgical, Powered
21CFR Part 878.4810
Product Code: GEX
Review Panel: General & Plastic Surgery
3. Predicate Device Information:
K#003614, LightSheer™ Pulsed Diode Array Laser System
4. Device Description:
The Milseman Premium Pulsed Diode Array Laser System delivers pulsed laser
light at 800 nm wavelength. The device consists of three interconnected
sections: the system console, the handle hose (umbilical cord) to the handpiece,
and the handpiece. The laser pulsed energy is delivered through the handpiece.
A user is able to select specific laser parameters from the touch screen on top of
the console.

5. Intended Use:
The Milesman Premium Pulsed Diode Array Laser System is intended for use in
general and plastic surgery and dermatology procedures for the treatment of
vascular lesions, such as angiomas, hemangiomas, telangiectasia and other
benign vascular lesions and treatment for pseudofolliculitis barbae.
The Milesman Premium is also used for removal of unwanted hair, permanent
hair reduction and the treatment of benign pigmented lesions and leg veins
in all skin types (Fitzpatrick I-VI), including tanned skin.

6. Comparison to Predicate Device:
The Milesman Premium and the LightSheer ET are very similar or identical in
terms of the device structure and its technology. Both systems are medical laser
devices that deliver intense pulsed light at 800nm and are designed for effective
photothermolysis treatment of soft tissue in general and plastic surgery, i.e.
benign pigmented lesions, vascular lesions, leg veins, and removal of unwanted
hair and permanent hair reduction.
The main differences between the Milesman Premium and LightSheer™ devices
are in the refrigeration systems and in the number of diode lasers. The
Milesman Premium and predicate LightSheer™ ET use different methods for
obtaining the refrigeration with Milesman Premium refrigeration based on
refrigeration by compression which is more efficient than thermoelectric
refrigeration used by the predicate device. The diode laser array of Milesman
Premium is formed by 2 matrixes of 10 the bars. The LightSheer™ ET diode
array is formed by 2 matrixes of 35 bars. Due to a different method of bars
assembly, the Milesman Premium is able to deliver the same amount of energy
as LightSheer™ while using fewer diode lasers.
The above features of Milesman Premium do not introduce any new questions
regarding the safety and effectiveness of the device.

7. Performance Data:
The Milseman Premium Pulsed Diode Array Laser System and the predicate
LightSheer™ Pulsed Diode Array Laser System have very similar specifications
and indications for use and as such, the performance data are not required.

8. Discussion of Clinical Tests Performed:
Non-Applicable

9. Conclusion:
The Milseman Premium Pulsed Diode Array Laser System has the same
intended use and similar characteristics as the LightSheer™ Pulsed Diode Array
Laser System. Moreover, documentation supplied in this submission
demonstrates that any differences in their technological characteristics do not
raise any new questions of safety or effectiveness. Thus, the Milesman Premium
System is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.

Trade/Device Name: Milesman Premium Pulsed Diode Array Laser System

Regulation Number: 21 CFR 878.4810

Regulation Name: Laser surgical instrument for use in general, and plastic surgery and in

dermatology

Regulatory Class: II

Product Code: GEX

Dated: November 21, 2007

Received: November 23, 2007
Dear Mr. Lehtonen:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

Page 2 —- Mr. Daniel W. Lehtonen
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance
at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or (240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address
