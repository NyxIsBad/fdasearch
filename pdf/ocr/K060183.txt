Common Name: Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC) Integrated Filter Probes
and Adapter
Trade/Proprietary Name: ERBE APC Integrated Filter Probes and Adapter
Classification Name: Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation device and
accessories (21CFR878.4400)
Product Code: GE
Legally Marketed Device: APC Connector Hose and Probes submitted in the ERBE
510(k) Number K013348 as well as APC Membrane Filter
(as an Accessory) in ERBE 510(k) Number K024047
Note: The APC Integrated Filter Probes and Adapter are being submitted in this
premarket notification are modified from the accessories in the above 510(k)s. The
modifications were determined to require a 510(k) submission.
Device Description:
The APC Integrated Filter Probes incorporate a filter similar to the APC Membrane Filter
and the hose (specifically the length) of an APC Connector Hose into one device. See
Section IV, Appendix 1, Product Pictures (IV-2). The Probes are flexible. They are
provided in various lengths, diameter sizes, and tip configurations to accommodate the
various size/types of endoscopes for a variety of applications (i.e., the treatment of
various target tissues inside a patient). The working lengths {i.e., the segment of the
Probe that would go down a scope) of the APC Integrated Filter Probes are 4.9ft. (1.5m)
to 9.8ft. (3m). The working diameters of the Probes are 4.5 French (1.5mm) to 9.6
French (3.2mm). The Probes have either an axial (straight fire), lateral (side fire), or
circumferential opening allowing the energy to be delivered straight, at a 45 to 90
degree angle. or directly to target tissue regardless of the probe's position. The three
types of openings for the APC Integrated Filter Probes allow the physician a choice in
the direction or the option not to have to consider the direction (just proximity) of
delivering the argon plasma to the treatment site which is based upon tissue resistance.

510K SUMMARY le “4 2 4, (s)
Note: Since the last 510(k), two (2) additional APC Probes became apart of the product
line. The modifications were insignificant. One involved a different outer diameter and
length, but the changes were within the ranges of dimensions that were already
included in approved Probes. The other involved modifying the tip of a side fire probe
for circumferential application. Besides the modification to the tip shape, the bonding
material changed to Vitadur Alpha. However, the material difference in the tip did not
raise any biocompatibility issues.
For each Probe, the blue connector/filter end is made of plastics (including the
membrane filter) with brass contact pins coated with nickel. The filter is 0.45 um and
protects the Argon Plasma Coagulator (the Equipment) from contamination if there is a
backflow of blood or any other fluid contaminant. The hose part of the Probe is made of
Teflon (PTFE). Finally, the tube portion of the Probe is made of polyurethane, PTFE
and a stainless steel wafer shape electrode close to the tip for terminating electrical
current. Various glues/adhesives are used to secure all of the Probe’s parts. Ceramic
tips are bonded on the APC Integrated Filter Side Fire and Circumferential Probes.
Functionality and reliability of the Probes were demonstrated through validation testing
using Recognized Standards. All added or modified materials in the APC Integrated
Filter Probes were evaluated for biocompatibility with no problem found (See Section Ill,
Biocompatibility, tII-10 to I1I-19).
The APC Integrated Filter Probes are provided sterile by means of ethylene oxide and
are disposable (Single Use) [Note: The sterilization cycle has been validated. See
Section III, Sterilization Information, !l-20.].
The APC Integrated Filter Probe Adapter is a flexible connecting cable. See Section IV,
Appendix 1, Product Pictures (IV-3). It connects the APC Integrated Filter Probe to an
ERBE Argon Plasma Coagulator. The Adapter is a conduit for both electrosurgical
current and argon gas. It is approximately 13-1/2” in length. The connector ends of the
Adapter are made of plastics. The cable portion of the Adapter is silicone. The
Adapter's performance was validated via Recognized Standards. The APC Integrated
Filter Probe Adapter is provided non-sterile and is reusable (Note: The Adapter only
needs to be externally cleaned/disinfected unless it is contaminated.).
The APC Integrated Filter Probes and Adapter are accessories of the ERBE Argon
Plasma Coagulator Models APC 300 and APC 2 [Note: The Coagulator is used with an
associated ERBE ElectroSurgical Unit (ESU)]. The APC Integrated Filter Probe
Adapter attaches to gas as well as electrical inputs of the Coagulator and then to an
APC Integrated Filter Probe [Note: It is possible to connect an APC Integrated Filter
probe directed to ERBE Coagulator APC 2 Model if it has an FiAPC Receptacle). An
endoscope is manipulated inside the patient to locate tissue that requires treatment.
Upon finding the target tissue, the Probe is threaded into the working channel of the
endoscope, until the tip of the APC Integrated Filter Probe slightly protrudes from the
end of the scope. The opening of the Probe is positioned towards/in close proximity of
the area to be treated (Note: The APC Integrated Filter Probes have depth marker rings
close to the tip for positioning purposes.). The APC/ESU system is activated via a

footswitch. When high frequency voltage reaches the critical level and the proximity to
tissue is close enough, electrically conductive argon plasma forms in the gas stream.
This allows the current to flow between the probe and the tissue. Current density upon
arrival at the tissue surface causes coagulation. The application of the energy to the
tissue is uniform and contact free.

Intended Use:

The APC Integrated Filter Probes are intended for use in Argon Plasma Coagulation
(APC). The devices are used to treat many conditions in endoscopy for various surgical
procedures.

Note: The APC Integrated Filter Probe Adapter is just the attachment piece to connect
an APC Integrated Filter Probe to an ERBE Coagulator Model APC 300. The Adapter is
only needed for the ERBE APC 2 Model if a FIAPC Receptacle is not installed.
Similarities and Differences of the Modified Device to the Current Device (Predicate
Comparison/Substantial Equivalence):

APC Integrated Filter Probes and Adapter

Similarities

The APC Integrated Filter Probes have the same performance, working dimensional
and tip specifications (i.e., working diameter and lengths as well as tip configurations),
intended use, labeling, and packaging specifications as the predicate APC Probes. The
APC Integrated Filter Probes incorporate a filter similar to and performs like the
predicate APC Membrane Filter. Also like the predicates, the Filter Probes are provided
sterile by ethylene oxide and are single use. Furthermore, the hose length of the APC
Integrated Filter Probes is the same as the APC Connector Hose. Like the predicate
APC Probes, the APC Integrated Filter Probes have an instrument recognition system.
If attached directly into an ERBE Argon Plasma Coagulator Model APC 2 via an FIAPC
receptacle, the Coagulator recognizes the Probe diameter size and automatically sets
conservative default settings.

The APC Integrated Filter Probe Adapter is basically the connectors of the APC
Connector Hose. The connectors that attach to an ERBE Coagulator are the same as
the connectors on the APC Connector Hose. The APC Integrated Filter Probe Adapter
has the same type of materials (plastics and silicone), performance specifications,
intended use, labeling, and packaging specifications as the predicate APC Connector
Hose. Also like the predicate, it is provided non-sterile and is reusable.

Differences

The APC Integrated Filter Probes have a different connector end as well as
incorporates a filter and length of hose (Note: Due to having the filter at the end of the
Probes. the connector was modified. This was also done so that it only fits its
designated Adapter.). The structural modifications of changing the connector end didn't

raise any safety or efficacy issues. The connector fits snugly on the designated Adapter
(ie., the conduit to the ERBE Coagulator). Also no negative impact was found with the
dimensional modification of including a filter and the hose in the Probes. The filter in the
Probe is 0.45 um as compared to the stand alone APC Membrane Filter size being 0.2
um. The larger pore size was found to be sufficient in keeping backflow fluid from
reaching the Adapter or Coagulator. The slight materials changes (i.e., in plastics, the
metal, and/or in glues) were found to be acceptable in producing a functionally reliable
Probe. The instrument recognition system in the APC Integrated Filter Probes are
chipped (EPROM) based as compared to the predicate APC Probes which are
recognized via resistors. The chipped based recognition system is more specific and
can provide more information. Finally; slightly different plastics, metals, and adhesives
were used in the APC Integrated Filter Probes in comparison to the predicate APC
Membrane Filter, Probes, and Connector Hose. The materials were found via validation
testing and applied Recognized Standards to work well in the APC Integrated Filter
Probes and the materials are biocompatible. See Section Ill, Biocompatibility and
Summary of Design Control Activities.

The APC Integrated Filter Probe Adapter is different that the APC Connector Hose in
that it doesn’t have the hose portion and the connector to the Probe was modified so it
only attaches to the APC Integrated Filter Probes. The dimensional modification of not
having the hose portion and the structural modification to the end that connects to the
APC Filter Probes do not raise any safety or efficacy concerns for the Adapter. The
APC Integrated Filter Probe Adapter connects snugly to the Filter Probes. It was also
found to function properly through validated testing and using Recognized Standards.
The Adapter is also different that the predicate APC Connector Hose in that the Adapter
has a resistor instrument recognition system. If the Adapter is used, it overrides specific
probe recognition. However, no safety or efficacy issues are expected because the
Adapter's resistor sets the lowest/most conservative default settings (i.e., gas flow and
wattage) on an ERBE Coagulator. As a result for the Probe being used, the settings
adjustments on the ERBE Coagulator would only be upward. Setting maximums for the
gas flow rate and wattage are specified for each APC Probe in the Notes On Use (NOU)
for the Probes. in the “How to Use” section of the NOU, the user is also directed to
setting limitations and instructed not to exceed maximums for the APC Probe being
used. If the gas flow rate limit is appreciably exceeded when using the Adapter and the
smallest diameter APC Probe, then the Coagulator errors preventing activation. With
the Adapter and the largest diameter APC Probe the maximum gas flow rate is limited:
however, no problem with in the clinical environment is expected. Typically, desired
settings are established during test firing of the Probe. Therefore, no problems in
regards to not having specific probe recognition are expected. Biocompatibility testing
was not necessary because the Adapter doesn’t come in contact with the patient.

510K SUMMARY
Note: Incorporating the filter in the Probes eliminates the need to reprocess the Adapter
between cases as compared with the APC Connector Hose because backflow
contamination can not reach the Adapter or Coagulator.
All the changes have been verified or validated in design control.
Conclusion:
The APC Integrated Filter Probes and Adapter have the same intended use, principles
of operation, and technological characteristics as the accessories in the previously
cleared predicate devices. None of the changes/modifications were found to have a
safety or efficacy affect on the APC Integrated Filter Probes and Adapter.
