Date of Summary: November 18, 2004 Classification Name: Laser Instrument,

Surgical Powered
Common Name: Surgical Laser Instrument Proprietary —_Atrilaze™ Soft Tissue
Ablation System

Description of Device: The Altrilaze Soft Tissue Ablation System consists of a
generator designed for the delivery of 810nm laser light and a hand held fiber optic light delivery
device (probe) fitted with a standard SMA 905 connector at the proximal end. The system may be
used in conjunction with surgical treatment for hemostasis, incision, ablation, coagulation and
vaporization of tissue as required by the clinician.
Statement of Intended Use: |The MedicalCV Atrilaze Soft Tissue Ablation System is
indicated for the delivery of 810nm laser light to soft tissue to include cardiac tissue, during
surgical procedures. Indications include the incision, excision, dissection, vaporization, ablation
or coagulation of soft tissue.
Warning: The Atrilaze Ablation System is not indicated for the treatment of cardiac
arrhythmias.

The risk of actual damage to adjacent organs from the instrument exists and
perforation, rupture or tearing of tissue, may occur as a complication of laser use. Burns can
occur if the laser energy is not correctly applied. These complications may be serious.

Summary of S&E
Page 2 of 2
Technological Comparison: — The Atrilaze Soft Tissue Ablation System is a self contained
compact surgical laser that utilizes gallium aluminum arsenide (GaAlAs) semiconductor diodes to
generate near-infrared laser radiation. A fiber optic delivery system (probe) is coupled to the laser
via an SMA 905 connector to deliver laser radiation to the target tissue(s). For purposes of this
submission, the Atrilaze Soft Tissue Ablation System was compared to the following predicate
device(s):
e Biolitec/Ceramoptec Ceralas D10-25 Fiber-coupled Diode Laser System (K001975)
¢ CardioFocus Diode Laser System (K013201)
Testing: The results of biocompatibility testing support that the materials used in the
manufacture of the Altrilaze Soft Tissue Ablation disposable probe are non-toxic, non-hemolytic,
and non-pyrogenic. All biocompatibility testing was conducted under Good Laboratory Practices
per 21 CFR Part 58. Performance testing for the Atrilaze Soft Tissue Ablation System included
compliance to manufacturing specifications for Power Output, Tip Pull-Off, Pressure and Flow
for the fiber optic delivery device, also visual evaluation of the lesions obtained using the
Altrilaze Soft Tissue Ablation System on cardiac tissue was performed. Testing demonstrated that
the Altrilaze Soft Tissue Ablation System is substantially equivalent to the predicate devices for
ablation of soft tissue.

Dear Mr. Steger:
This letter corrects our substantially equivalent letter of November 30, 2004.
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices,
good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III] (PMA),
it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be
found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050,
This letter will allow you to continue marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your
device to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0120. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
