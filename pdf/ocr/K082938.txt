ieee aeeess An Indium Gallium Arsenide Phosphorus solid-state laser diode emits _
infrared laser energy to the various oral soft tissues targeted during procedure. This energy is
transmitted via a flexible fiberoptic cable to the handpiece that emits the energy to the targeted
tissue site. A visible light is emitted at the same time to visually pinpoint the treatment location.
The power output and pulse width may be adjusted to specific user requirements.

ezlase™ Expanded Indications for Use

INDICATIONS FOR USE:
This device may be used for the following indications:
a Light activation for bleaching matenials for teeth whitening
= Laser-assisted whitening/bleaching of teeth
CONTRAINDICATIONS:
All clinical procedures performed with the ezlase™ must be subjected to the same clinical
judgment and care as with traditional techniques. Patiént risk must always be considered and fully
understood before clinical treatment. The clinician must completely understand the patient's
medical history prior to treatment. Exercise caution for general medical conditions, which might
contraindicate a local procedure. Such conditions may include allergy to local or topical
anesthetics, heart disease, lung disease, bleeding disorders, sleep apnea, and immune system
deficiency, or any medical conditions or medications that may contraindicate use of certain
light/laser type sources associated with this device. Medical clearance from the patient’s physician
is advisable when doubt exists regarding treatment.
SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE:
The purpose of this 510(k) is to expand the current ezlase™ indications for use (K061898) to
include teeth whitening, an indication already cleared by the FDA for equivalent medical devices as
part of the following 510(k) submissions: K003385 (Twilite™), K993002, K050824, K072106,
(Ceralas D laser systems), and K060114 (Vectra™). Based on this comparison, the ezlase™ is
substantially equivalent in relation to previous cleared devices.
CONCLUSION:
The indications requested by this 510(k) are the same as those previously cleared by the FDA for
other equivalent devices. Substantial equivalency for the ezlase™ has been determined through
comparison to previously cleared devices.
