Summary of Clinical performance data
The safety and efficacy of radiofrequency devices emitting energy
with afrequency of 1000KHz with power of 10 to 100 W is
well established in scientific research and clinical studies. Multiple
, - studies with these and similar systems have shown safety in
dermatologic therapy and the devices were cleared by the FDA for
therapy of wrinkles and rhytides.
