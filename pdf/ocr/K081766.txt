Device Description 2 2 h
The PKS Omni Instrument is a single-use device with a classic laparoscopic looms.
layout, with a 5mm shaft available in several lengths from 15 to 45cm, supporting
symmetrically opening steel jaws. These are curved in a manner similar to Maryland forceps
and other laparoscopic graspers, and contain bipolar electrosurgical elements that allow
coagulation, cutting and vessel sealing. It is intended for use with the Gyrus ACMI G400
workstation

Technological Characteristics and Substantial Equivalence

Like the predicate Zip Wing cleared under K023493, the upper and lower jaws contain the
electrical elements that when placed at the desired tissue site, induce the cutting or
coagulating/sealing tissue effect as the applicable generator mode is actuated.

The device is a refinement of already proven existing technology, Gyrus’s PlasmaKinetic (PK)
technology developed for dry field surgery (K050460). It relies upon simultaneous contact of
both active and return electrodes of the bipolar device with the tissue. Other Gyrus devices use
this principle in two modes to achieve cutting and coagulation effects. The Device is
constructed of similar materials as other Gyrus ACMI electrosurgical devices.
The PKS Omni is intended to offer cutting and coagulation using bipolar electrosurgical
energy application in a manner similar to other devices on the market (such as Gyrus ACMI
Open Forceps (K024286,) and Valley Lab Ligasure V (K031011) for coagulation of vessels,
and Plasmacision electrodes (K050460) for bipolar cutting and surface coagulation of tissue).
Summary of Safety and Effectiveness
The Gyrus ACMI Inc. PKS Omni Instrument, as described in this submission, is substantially
equivalent to the predicates in intended use, principles of operation and fundamental scientific
technology and raises no new issues of safety and effectiveness.

Dear Ms. Calzetta:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
