Classification: Class II (21 CFR § 878.4810 Laser Surgical Instrument for use

in General and Plastic Surgery and in Dermatology)
Common Name: Dermatology Laser, Voeam Pulsed Dye Laser System
Predicate Devices: Candela Vbeam Pulsed Dye Laser (K013784), SLS Biophile Ltd

NLite (K013461)
Description:
The Vbeam is a 595 nm flash-lamp excited pulsed dye medical laser, controlled by an embedded
microprocessor, to be used for the treatment of benign cutaneous vascular lesions, such as facial
and leg telangiectasia, rosacea, port wine stains, hemangiomas, angioma, spider angioma,
Poikiloderma of Civatee and benign cutaneous lesions, such as warts, scars, striea and psoriasis.
Photocoagulation of benign cutaneous lesion and benign vascular lesion in Gynecology. Treatment
of periorbital wrinkles and wrinkies. The Vbeam laser is used with the Candela Dynamic Cooling
Device, which provides a short burst of cryogen spray prior to firing the laser pulse. The laser
output energy is delivered via an optical fiber to a handpiece, which produces circular beams with
diameters of 5, 7, 10 and 3 x 10 millimeters on the skin. The cryogen, which is housed within the
laser enclosure, is delivered via a hose to a nozzle located in the handpiece.
The Candela Vbeam Pulsed Dye Laser is equipped with safety interlock systems to protect patients
and operators. Users of the device make selections from an onboard control panel to regulate
operation during treatment.

Testing:
As a laser product, the Vbeam Pulsed Dye Laser is required to conform and does conform to the
Laser Performance Standard (21 CFR 1040). In addition the Vbeam conforms to the UL 2601
Electrical Safety Standard and with the Harmonized Standard EN 60601-1-2, Part 2 established by
and required by the European Community.
Summary of Substantial Equivalence:
The Candela Vbeam Laser has the same intended use, utilizes similar operating principles and
matches key design aspects, including similar spot size, the same wavelength and / or the same
maximum delivered power as the predicate devices.
On the basis of similarities in methods of assembly, method of operation, clinical performance data
and intended uses, Candela Corporation believes that its Candela Vbeam Laser System is
substantially equivalent to the predicate devices.
