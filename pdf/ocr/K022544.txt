H Laser System under 510(k) #K984591 and maintain the same previously
cleared indications for use as stated below.

The Dornier Medilas™ H Laser is intended to be used in cutting, vaporization,
ablation, and coagulation of soft tissue in conjunction with endoscopic
equipment (including laparoscopes, hysteroscopes, bronchoscopes,
gastroscopes, cystoscopes, and colonoscopes), or in incision/excision,
vaporization, ablation and coagulation of soft tissue in contact or non-contact
open surgery (with or without hand piece).

The Dornier Medilas™ H Laser is indicated for use in medicine and surgery, in
the following specialties: Urology, Pulmonology, Arthroscopy, Lithotripsy,
Gastroenterology, Gynecology, ENT, and General Surgery.

5. Description of Technological Characteristics and Substantial Equivalence
From a clinical perspective and comparing design specifications, the Dornier
Medilas™ H Laser Fiber Cables and the predicate device, SlimLine Fibers in
365, 550 and 1,000 micron sizes included in the Lumenis Modified Coherent
VersaPulse Dual Wavelength Surgical Lasers and Delivery Accessories
clearance, are substantially equivalent.

An analysis of equivalence has been conducted according to the “510(k)
Substantial Equivalence Decision-Making Process” flowchart from the Blue Book
Memorandum #86-3 and included as an attachment to this notification. Based
on the technological characteristics and overall performance of the devices,
Dornier MedTech America, Inc. believes that no significant differences exist
between the Dornier Medilas™ H Laser Fiber Cables and the predicate device.
Dornier believes the minor differences of the Dornier Medilas™ H Laser Fiber
Cables and its predicate laser device should not raise any concerns regarding
the overall safety or effectiveness.

Dear Mr. Thomas:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class Il (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 — Mr. Tim Thomas
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801 and
additionally 21 CFR Part 809.10 for in vitro diagnostic devices), please contact the Office of
Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Additionally, for questions on the promotion and advertising of
your device, please contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4639. Also, please note the
regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97).
Other general information on your responsibilities under the Act may be obtained from the
