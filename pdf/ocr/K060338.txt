IV. Product Description
The Lumenis Selecta is a fully integrated flash lamp pumped, solid state, Nd:YAG
ophthalmic surgical laser system intended for use in the treatment of ocular pathology
and for use as a diagnostic slit lamp.
The Selecta Family of Ophthalmic Lasers, Delivery Device and Accessories are comprised of the
following configurations:
Selecta 1064°— a Nd:YAG laser providing Q-switched laser pulses at a wavelength of
1064nm for use in photodisruption of ocular tissue (posterior capsulotomy, papillary :
membranectomy, iridotomy). The 1064nm treatment beam delivers a 4 nsec, 0.3-10mJ
adjustable and selectable single, double or triple pulse of energy. It is conditioned through
beam shaping optics to generate a photodisruption micro pulse of plasma at a precision
adjustable location relative to the visual focal plane (located at slit lamp center of
rotation) and along the slit lamp objective lens axis. A twin aiming beam is also focused by
the slit lamp objective to a converging 20um spot located at the focal point of the lens. The

focal point of photodisruption is adjustable 0-350m in the posterior direction by the
physician relative to this convergence of the twin aiming beams.
Selecta SLT® — a Nd:YAG laser providing Q-switched frequency doubled pulses at a
wavelength of 532nm for use in selective laser trabeculoplasty. The treatment beam
delivers a 4nsec, 0.1-2mJ adjustable single pulse of energy. The aiming and treatment
beams are coaxial with each other and focused by the slit lamp objective to a 400um spot
at the focal point of the lens.
Selecta Duet® — a Nd:YAG laser providing Q-switched laser pulses at a wavelength of
1064 nanometers for use in photodisruption or Q-switched frequency doubled pulses at a
wavelength of 532nm for use in selective laser trabeculoplasty, depending upon the mode
selected. The Selecta Duo contains two aiming beam modules that produce a single beam
for the 532nm mode and a dual beam for the 1064nm mode, respectively.
LaserLink S — a laser slit lamp delivery adaptor that may be coupled to each of the above
Selecta models and connected to a currently cleared Lumenis 532nm photocoagulator to
allow the physician to use the Selecta slit lamp to deliver 532nm continuous wave laser
energy for photocoagulation.
Selecta Duo — a Selecta 1064 and LaserLink S slit lamp delivery device with a currently
cleared Lumenis 532nm photocoagulator
Selecta Trio — a Selecta Duet and LaserLink S slit lamp delivery device with a currently
cleared Lumenis 532nm photocoagulator
Selecta SLT and LaserLink S$ with a currently cleared Lumenis 532nm photocoagulator
Vv. Indications for Use
Selecta 1064: photodisruption of ocular tissue using light energy emitted by a Nd:YAG
laser, including discission of the posterior capsule of the eye (posterior
capsulotomy), and discission of pupillary membranes (pupillary
membranectomy) in aphakic and pseudophakic patients, and
iridotomy/iridectomy
Selecta SLT: _ selective laser trabeculoplasty
Selecta Duet: photodisruption of ocular tissue using light energy emitted by a Nd:YAG
laser, including discission of the posterior capsule of the eye (posterior
capsulotomy), and discission of pupillary membranes (pupillary
membranectomy) in aphakic and pseudophakic patients, and
iridotomy/iridectomy; and
selective laser trabeculoplasty
LaserLink $: laser delivery system for use by an ophthalmologist in the treatment of
ocular tissue;

, laser delivery system indicated for use for a variety of ophthalmic uses,
including the indications specified in the laser operator manual. Refer to
the laser operator manual, Indications for Use section.

The Selecta 1064, Selecta SLT and Selecta Duet Ophthalmic Lasers are also intended

for use as a diagnostic slit lamp, specifically,

An AC-powered slit lamp biomicroscope intended for use in eye
examination of the anterior segment, from the cornea epithelium to the
posterior capsule. It is used to aid in the diagnosis of diseases or trauma
which affects the structural properties of the anterior segment.

Selecta Duo: — same indications for use as a Selecta 1064® and LaserLink S slit lamp
delivery device with a currently cleared Lumenis 532nm
photocoagulator

Selecta Trio: same indications for use as a Selecta Duet and LaserLink S slit lamp
delivery device with a currently cleared Lumenis 532nm
photocoagulator

VI. Rationale for Substantial Equivalence
The devices in this submission are identical to the predicate devices. The purpose of this
510(K) is for a name change only with no changes to the device or the indications for use.
VIL. Performance Data
None
VIII, Conclusion

The Family of Selecta Ophthalmic Laser Systems, Delivery Device and Accessories are

substantially equivalent to the predicate laser devices, delivery systems and accessories.

The Family of Selecta Ophthalmic Laser Systems, Delivery Device and Accessories

share the same intended use, indications for use, and technological characteristics as the

predicate laser systems.

Dear Ms. Hoy:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments. or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food. Druy.
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket appreval application (PMA}
You may, therefore, market the device. subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. [he
