A. Determination of Substantial Equivalence JAN ~ 7 2004
VNUS Vessel and Tissue Coagulation System (proprietary name: TBD)

B. Common Name
Bipolar Electrosurgical Instrument

Cc. Predicate Device(s)
VNUS® Closure® System (K972541);
VNUS® Closure® System (K982816, KO03092, and K030557),
Cameron-Miller Vein Eraser System (Pre-amendment), and
ArthroCare Electrosurgery System (K992581)

D. Device Description
The VNUS Vessel and Tissue Coagulation System is a bipolar, high frequency
electrosurgical system designed for use in general surgical procedures where blood
vessel and tissue coagulation is desired. It consist of three main components: The
VNUS Vessel and Tissue Coagulation Device (proprietary name: TBD), the
Radiofrequency (RF) Generator, and the Instrument Cable.
The VNUS Vessel and Tissue Coagulation Device is sterile disposable device intended
for a single-use only. The device’s function is to deliver bipolar RF energy to the desired
treatment site and relay temperature and other feedback to the RF Generator. The
disposable device is available in three bipolar configurations for selection by the
physician based on preference for method of vessel access.
The RF Generator is a high frequency electronic, bipolar, microprocessor / software
controlled instrument. It allows the user to set Power, Temperature and Time values,
and provides user displays of Power, Temperature and Time (set-points and measured
values) as ‘well as measured Impedance and user messages. The RF Generator
remains out of the sterile field during use, and is provided non-sterile.
The instrument cable connects the disposable device to the RF generator. The
Instrument Cable is provided non-sterile, and is user sterilizable by autoclave. It has
been validated to multiple steam sterilization cycles. Both ends of the cable are identical
to eliminate connection errors.

E. Intended Use
The VNUS Vessel and Tissue Coagulation System (proprietary name: TBD) is intended
for use in vessel and tissue coagulation.

F. Intended Use of Predicate Devices
The specified predicate devices are indicated for “coagulation of blood vessels in
patients with superficial vein reflux” (VNUS Closure System), “ablation and coagulation
of blood vessels during general surgical procedures” (Cameron Miller Vein Eraser), and
“for resection, ablation and coagulation of soft tissues and hemostasis of blood vessels
in orthopedic, arthroscopic, and spinal procedures” (ArthroCare Electrosurgical system).

. G. Technological Comparison /

The RF energy is widely used in electrosurgical equipment for many years. The safety

and efficacy of such devices has been well established for a variety of intended uses.

The use of bipolar RF energy delivery has potential advantages over monopolar

systems. No grounding pads are required, and the potential for damage to adjacent

tissue is minimized, as the patient is no longer the return path for electrical current. The
efficiency of bipolar RF energy delivery allows systems such as the VNUS RF Generator
to be used at lower voltage and power settings as compared with monopolar systems.

The technological characteristics and principals of operation of the VNUS Vessel and

Tissue Coagulation Device (proprietary name: TBD) are substantially equivalent to the

noted predicate devices. All devices rely on the delivery of RF energy to achieve their

intended use.
H. Discussion of Clinical/Non-Clinical Tests and Conclusions

Performance

Results of in-vitro testing demonstrate that the VNUS Vessel and Tissue Coagulation

System (proprietary name: TBD) is safe and effective for its intended function.

Biocompatibility

The materials used in the VNUS Vessel and Tissue Coagulation System (proprietary

name: TBD) has been shown to be biocompatible.
I. Summary of Safety and Effectiveness

Based upon the intended use, design, materials, function, comparison with currently

marketed devices and the non-clinical testing performed by VNUS, it is concluded that

the VNUS Vessel and Tissue Coagulation System (proprietary name: TBD) is
substantially equivalent to the noted predicate devices.

Trade/Device Name: VNUS® Vessel and Tissue Coagulation System

Regulation Number: 21 CFR 878.4400

Regulation Name: Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation device and accessories

Regulatory Class: II /

Product Code: GEI

Dated: November 10, 2003

Received: November 12, 2003
Dear Mr. Nanavati:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (?MA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and. prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class I (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, ‘litle 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination docs not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CER 1000-1050.

Page 2 - Mr. Sam Nanavati
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part.801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
