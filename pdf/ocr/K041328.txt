D. Predicate Devices be 4 @ 93
The Smith & Nephew Smith & Nephew ElectroBlade’ Resector and Smith & Nephew
ElectroBlade’® Adaptor combination is substantially equivalent in intended use and
fundamental scientific technology to the following legally marketed devices in
commercial distribution: Smith & Nephew ElectroBlade’ Resector and ERBE ICC 350.
The predicate device combination was cleared in KO31675 on June 20, 2003.
E. Description of Device
The Smith & Nephew ElectroBlade® Resector combines electrosurgical and shaver
technology to provide hemostasis and mechanical cutting in a single instrument.
The Smith & Nephew ElectroBlade® Adaptor is a transformer that converts the power
output of the generator into a higher current / lower voltage output.
F. Intended Use
The Smith & Nephew ElectroBlade Adaptor, when used in conjunction with the Smith
& Nephew ElectroBlade® Resector is indicated in arthroscopic surgical procedures of
large and small articular cavities for resection and excision of soft tissue. The Smith
& Nephew ElectroBlade® Resector is effective in tissue resection and hemostasis of
bleeding vessels. It is intended for arthroscopic procedures using saline solution,
Ringer's lactate or other conductive solutions as an irrigant under direct or videoassisted fiber-optic visualization.
G. Comparison of Technological Characteristics
The Smith & Nephew Smith & Nephew ElectroBlade’ Resector and Smith & Nephew
ElectroBlade® Adaptor combination is substantially equivalent in design, materials,
function and intended use to the following legally marketed devices in commercial
distribution: Smith & Nephew ElectroBlade® Resector and ERBE ICC 350. The
predicate device combination was cleared in K031675 on June 20, 2003.
H. Summary Performance Data
The proposed device combination will perform as well as the predicate device
combination to the following standards at the time of commercialization:
e ANSI/AAMI! HF18-1993 for Electrosurgical Devices
e IEC 601-1(Al + A2) Medical Electrical Equipment: Part 1 General Requirements
