i Device Description:
1 The Given Electrosurgical Needle is a single patient use needle electrode for use in
‘ monopolar electrosurgical handpieces. The skin which is usually anesthetized with a topical
and/or injectable anesthetic. The monopolar generator is set at the cutting mode to 1.5 to
1.75 Watts. The needle is introduced into the vein located within the skin. The current is
- then applied with destruction of the vein while the insulation protects the surrounding tissue.
: The needle is withdrawn and additional veins are then treated in a similar fashion. The
: needle is made of Tungsten Carbide and the insulation is Parylene-C which are both
i biocompatible materials that have been used extensively in electrosurgical electrodes.
Intended Use:
The Given Electrosurgical Needle is used to apply electrosurgical current directly into a
. spider vein located within the skin. The electrosurgical current destroys the spider vein.
Similarities and Differences of the Proposed Devices to the Predicate Devices:
Similarities
\ The Given Electrosurgical Needle has the same basic technology characteristics for an
! electrosurgical electrode for use in monopolar electrosurgical handpieces. It is intended for
precision cutting and cauterizing of soft tissue as the predicate devices, and the indications
: for use are the same except for the specific additions as noted below.

Differences

i The Given Electrosurgical Needle utilizes some of the exact materials as the predicate

i devices; however, all materials are known biocompatible materials that have been used in
electrosurgical electrodes or electrosurgical instruments.

|

| Conclusion:

i The Given Electrosurgical Needle has the same principles of operation, and technological
: characteristics as the predicate device. The Given Electrosurgical Needle has determined a
! specific intended use from results of testing as presented in the submission.
