I. Names
Device Names: Cutera Optional Pulsed Light Hand Piece Family
Primary Classification Name: — Laser Powered Surgical Instrument (and Accessories)
III. Predicate Devices
¢  Starlux/Estelux pulsed light hand pieces manufactured by Palomar (K033549,
K040081, K020941)
¢ Profile BBL manufactured by Sciton (K032460)
* PRIMA Pulsed Light Therapy System manufactured by CoolTouch.
IV. Product Description
The pulsed light delivery hand pieces are comprised of four main components:
> an “umbilical” cable and connector, that is permanently attached to the hand
piece body and is semi-permanently attached to the console system
(detachable by positive action from the user) that houses:
> electrical cables (to support the thermoelectric cooler associated with the
chilled hand piece tip, to provide power and a trigger source to the xenon flash
lamp, to provide detector signals and to connect a memory device that
identifies the hand piece);
> a supply and return water line (to remove the heat generated by the flash lamp
and thermoelectric cooler);
> the hand piece internals described above; and
> the hand piece housing the internals and connecting to the umbilical.
These hand pieces are accessories to be used on previously cleared Cutera console
systems where the 510(k) permitted use of pulsed light (a.k.a. flash lamp) hand
pieces.

V. Indications for Use
The Cutera Optional Pulsed Light Hand Piece Family is indicated for use in the
surgical, aesthetic and cosmetic applications requiring sclective photothermolysis
in the medical specialties of general and plastic surgery and dermatology. '
The Cutera Optional Pulsed Light Hand Piece Family is intended for the treatment !
of:
e Tattoos;
¢ Benign pigmented lesions including dyschromia, hyperpigmentation,
melasma, ephelides (freckles);

or permanent, hair reduction, and
¢ Mild to moderate inflammatory acne vulgaris.
VI. Rationale for Substantial Equivalence
The Cutera Optional Pulsed Light Hand Piece Family shares the same indications for use,
similar design features (including wavelength, light generation medium, power supply,
cooling and control system), functional features (including power output, spot size,
repetition rate, energy and fluence), and is therefore substantially equivalent to the above
. legally marketed predicate devices.
VII. Safety and Effectiveness Information
The new indications for use are based upon the indications for use for predicate pulsed
light device systems.
Technologically, the Cutera Optional Pulsed Light Hand Piece Family is substantially
equivalent to the listed predicate devices. Therefore the risks and benefits for the Cutera
Optional Pulsed Light Hand Piece Family are comparable to the predicate devices.
We therefore believe that there are no new questions of safety or effectiveness raised by
the introduction of this device.
