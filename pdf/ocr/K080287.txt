Device information:
Name of Device: Bipolar Electrode
Common Name: Tissue Ablation Accessory
Classification: Electrosurgical Cutting and Coagulation Device
Predicate Device information:
Oncobionic System, KO60054
Rita Medical UniBlate Electrosurgical Device, KO70101
Device Description:
The Oncobionic Bipolar Electrode combines two electrodes into one device. The combined
electrodes operate to deliver energy from the previously cleared Oncobionic System (K060054).

510k Summary Continued

Intended Use:
The Oncobionic Bipolar Electrode is intended to be used only with the Oncobionic System and
is intended for surgical ablation of soft tissue.
Comparison to Predicate Device:
The Oncobionic Bipolar Electrode created equivalent tissue ablation to the Rita Medical
UniBlate Electrosurgical Device. The Oncobionic System is as safe and effective as the
Oncobionic Electrode KO60054. We have compared the efficacy of our device to the predicate
devices and found them equivalent.
Performance Data:
We have included in-vivo test data, Attachment 1, which shows the Oncobionic Bipolar
Electrode to be at least as safe and effective as the predicate devices. This test shows that the
Oncobionic Bipolar Electrode is substantially equivalent to the predicate devices for creating
ablation zones in soft tissue.
Sterilization Validation:
The Sterilization method used for the single use Oncobionic Bipolar Electrode is Ethylene Oxide
Sterilization.
Software Validation:
The Oncobionic Bipolar Electrode does not use software.

Dear Mr. Juckett:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
