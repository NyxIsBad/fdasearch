Device Description:
General Description. The ERBE Monopolar Attachment [P/N 20139-094] is used with the Helix
Hydro-Jet™ and the ERBE Electrosurgical Generator (ESU) Systems (ICC or VIO Models).
The Helix Hydro-Jet™ is a hydraulic pressure delivery system that uses physiological saline to
cut and dissect soft tissue. The ERBE Electrosurgical Generator (ESU) Systems (ICC or VIO
Models) deliver High Frequency (HF) energy through the electrode tip of the ERBE Monopolar
Attachment for coagulation and cutting of tissue. The ERBE Monopolar Attachment for Helix
Hydro-Jet™ is made of stainless steel with plastic insulation except at the electrode tip (which
isolates the HF energy to only the tip surface). The ERBE Monopolar Attachment has a channel
and ring where the Helix Hydro-Jet™ Applicator slides into the Monopolar Attachment and is
held in place for the Physician. The Monopolar Attachment is provided non-sterile and is
reusable. (Note: The cleaning and sterilization processes are provided in the proposed draft
labeling, “Notes on Use” - ERBE Monopolar Attachment.)
intended Use:
The Monopolar Attachment combines the use of the Helix Hydro-Jet™ Applicator with suction
(Part Number 20139-074) with the use of monopolar coagulation and cutting (optional drip
ittigation is also available) when used in conjunction with an ERBE ESU (ICC or VIO Models).
Note: The Electrosurgical Unit (ESU) to be used must have a Monopolar 3-pin bovie ’
receptacle. The use of ERBE ESU ICC and VIO Models are recommended. Compatibility and
settings should be demonstrated/established prior to using a different Generator in the clinical
environment.

510K SUMMARY

Similarities and Differences of the Pro d_ Devices _to the Predicate Devices

Comparison/Substantial Equivalence):
Similarities
The ERBE Monopolar Attachment allows the physician to combine the use of the ERBE
Helix Hydro-Jet™ for water jet dissection with the ERBE Electrosurgical Generator (ESU)
Systems (ICC or VIO Models) for monopolar coagulation and cutting. The use of the ERBE
Monopolar Attachment does not change the way the Physician uses the ERBE Helix HydroJet™ System and Applicators or the ERBE Electrosurgical Generator (ESU) Systems (ICC
or VIO Models). The ERBE Monopolar Attachment for Helix Hydro-Jet™ has the same
intended use as the ERBE Helix Hydro-Jet™ System with the combined ability of the
intended use of the ERBE ESU. While the energy sources are still used separately, the
Monopolar Attachment combines their instrumentation parts into one handheld piece.
Differences
The ERBE Monopolar Attachment is different from the use of the ERBE Helix Hydro-Jet™
for water jet dissection with the ERBE Electrosurgical Generator (ESU) Systems (ICC or VIO
Models) for Monopolar coagulation/cutting in that the predicate method was for the
Physician to pick up each instrument separately, use the instrument, then pick up the next
instrument. Again while the energy sources are still used separately, the Monopolar
Attachment combines their instrumentation parts into one handheld piece.
All the instrument design changes have been verified or validated in design control by ERBE
Elektromedizin GmbH.

Conelusion:
The ERBE Monopolar Attachment for Helix Hydro-Jet™ has the same intended use,
Principles of operation, and technological characteristics as the predicate devices that were
previously cleared for market in a 510(k).
The ERBE Monopolar Attachment differs only in that it allows the Physician to combine the
instrumentation parts of the ERBE Helix™ Hydro-Jet for water jet dissection with the ERBE
Electrosurgical Generator (ESU) Systems (ICC or VIO Models) for monopolar coagulation
and cutting into one handheld piece.
In conclusion, there are no issues with the ERBE Monopolar Attachment for Helix HydroJet™ that would raise additional safety or efficacy issues when compared to the predicate
devices.

Dear Mr. Tartal:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class IT (Special Controls) or class I] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 — Mr. John Tartal
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
