Coagulation & Accessories

Decision Date 10/22/1999
Device Description:
During the use of RF surgery devices, power is transmitted via an electrode in
the contact zone to tissue. When RF energy reaches a certain upper limit, an arc
will occur at the contact zone of the active electrode to the tissue. This leads to a
quick warm-up of the intercellular fluid. This vaporization of the intercellular fluid
results into a burst of the cells and the tissue looses its cohesion, the electrode
then cuts. Lower RF-voltages (below 150veff) lead to a slower heat-up of the
tissue, resulting in coagulation with no separation. Short RF-impulses with high
voltage lead in a build-up of sparks together with a strong surface coagulation.
Cold plasma technology using Helium gas is a very gentle method for
coagulating or dissecting specific types of tissue. In contrast to conventional RF
surgery, the penetration depth related to tissue damage and the electrical strain
on the patient are significantly reduced (no electrical current flowing through the
patient). The significantly lower peak current value (as compared to conventional
spray coagulation) results in far less damage to tissue layers immediately
beneath the treatment area because constant sine-shaped currents are used.

510(k) Summary of Safety & Effectiveness
(as required by 21 CFR 807.92c)

indications for Use:
The devices are intended to cut and or coagulate soft biological tissue with gasenhanced coagulation during general surgical procedures. Typical users of this
system are trained medical professionals.

Performance Data: ,
The Soring GmbH CPC™ devices and predicate devices both use standard data
communications controls to detect errors. Both devices comply with IEC 950 —
Safety of Information Technology Equipment, CISPR 22, class A —
Electromagnetic Compatibility, IEC-801-2, IEC-801-3 — Electromagnetic
Compatibility, EEE 1003.1 — General Electrical Safety for medical devices, IEC
601-1 -Electrical Safety for medical devices using RF-power, IEC 601-2-2 —
Special specifications for the safety of RF-surgery units .

Conclusion:
Similar to the predicate device, the Soring GmbH CPC™ devices do not control
any life sustaining functions or services. The new devices and the predicate
devices share the same conformance to performance standards and both
function as RF surgery units. Based on the information supplied in this 510(k),
we conclude that the subject devices are safe, effective, and substantially
equivalent to the predicate devices.

Dear Mr. Alletto:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and we have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the
indications for use stated in the enclosure) to devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to
May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have
been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
(Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices,
- good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 — Mr. Carl Alletto
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
(301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/dsma/dsmamain.htm]
