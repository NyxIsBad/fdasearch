Device Trade Name: Smoothbeam Laser System
Device Common Name: Dermatology Laser
Classification: Class II (21 CFR § 878.4810 Laser Surgical Instrument for use in General

and Plastic Surgery and in Dermatology)
Predicate Device: Candela 1450 nm Diode laser (K002421)
Description of the Smoothbeam Laser System: The Diode laser is a diode medical laser, controlled by an
embedded processor, for use in dermatology for the treatment of back acne. The Candela Smoothbeam Laser
System is comprised of a power supply, optical delivery system, software control system and Dynamic Cooling
Device. The laser output energy is delivered via an optical fiber to a handpiece, which produces circular beams
on the skin. The Dynamic Cooling Device provides multiple bursts of cryogen spray during the laser
treatment. The cryogen is delivered via a hose to a nozzle located in the handpiece. The Dynamic Cooling
Device functions to cool the skin during the laser treatment minimizing thermal damage to skin during laser
treatment and reducing pain associated with laser treatment. The Candela Smoothbeam Laser System is

. equipped with safety interlock systems to protect patients and operators. Users of the device, make selections
from a control panel to regulate operation during the laser treatment.
Intended use of Smoothbeam Laser System: The Smoothbeam Laser System is indicated for the treatment
of back acne.
Performance Standards: As a laser product, the Smoothbeam Laser System is required to conform and does
conform to the Laser Performance Standard (21 CFR 1040). In addition, the device will conform to the UL
2601 Electrical Safety Standard and with the Harmonized Standard EN 60601-1-2, Part 2 established by the
European Community.
Clinical Performance Data: Clinical trials produced results that indicate that the Smoothbeam Laser System
is effective in the treatment of back acne.
Summary of Substantial Equivalence: The Candela Smoothbeam Laser System with an additional
indication for back acne, utilizes similar operating principles and matches key design aspects, including spot
size, similar wavelength and/or the same maximum delivered power as the predicate device. On the basis of
similarities in methods of assembly, method of operation and presentation of clinical data, Candela believes
that its Smoothbeam Laser System is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.
