Preparation Date : 3 July 2006

Device Submitted : LumaCare LC-122M
Non-coherent Light Source

Common Name : Light Therapy Device

Classification Name : Laser surgical instrument for use in general
and plastic surgery and in dermatology.

Product Code : GEX

Predicate Device : BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy
Illuminator Model 4170, manufactured by
DUSA Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (K031805)

Device Description : The LumaCare LC-122M Non-coherent
Light Source is a high intensity lamp
intended for the therapy of dermatological
disorders such as moderate inflammatory
acne vulgaris by emitting visible light in the
wavelength range 400-440nm (blue) with
fluences of order 10-100mW/cm*. The
principle parts of the system comprise of a
desktop base unit and a Fibre Optic Probe
(FOP) delivery system. The base unit
contains a mains supplied power supply unit
which powers a 250W halogen bulb, the
duration of the illumination being controlled
by a timing pcb with user-accessible
controls. The FOP delivery system
comprises of a ruggedised fibre bundle
assembly and (crucially) an optical filter
which selectively transmits only the
therapeutic blue light. A mechanical fixture

is also optionally available for holding the
output of the FOP delivery system at an
adjustable distance and direction relative to
the skin treatment area.

Intended Use : The LumaCare LC-122M Non-coherent
Light Source is intended to provide
therapeutic light to the body a?

Indications for Use : The LumaCare LC-122M Non-coherent
Light Source is generally indicated to treat
dermatological conditions. The LumaCare
LC-122M Non-coherent Light Source is
specifically indicated to treat moderate
inflammatory acne vulgaris.

Performance Data : The pre-clinical testing includes Electrical
Safety and EMC testing including the
requirements of IEC 60601-1:1988/A1/A2
“Medical electrical equipment - General
requirements for safety” and “IEC 60601-12:2002 “Medical electrical equipment General requirements for safety. Collateral
standard - Electromagnetic compaitibility.
Requirements and tests”

Substantial Equivalence: The LumaCare LC-122M Non-coherent
Light Source is substantially equivalent to
the previously cleared BLU-U Blue Light
Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator Model
4170. The LumaCare LC-122M has the
same intended use and the same general
and specific indications for use as the BLUU. The spectral output, mode of operation
and general operating principles for the
LumaCare LC-122M are similar to or the
same as the BLU-U. The LumaCare LC122M and the BLU-U are both light device
that are used to treat dermatological
conditions by exposing the surface of the
skin to light at precise wavelengths.
Although there are some differences in
method by which each device produces
light and is delivered to the treatment area,
these differences do not raise new
questions of safety of efficacy. Thus, the
LumaCare LC-122M Non-coherent Light
Source is substantially equivalent to the
BLU-U.

Dear Dr. Berry:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
