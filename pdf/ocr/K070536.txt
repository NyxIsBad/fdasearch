General Device The Dornier Medilas D Family Lasers are continuous-wave
Description: diode laser. emitting laser radiation in the invisible range of
940 nm. Each is calibrated during the manufacturing process
and during service calls. The end-user does not calibrate
fibers for this system. The Medilas D Family Lasers
incorporate a graphic display panel, which shows laser
operating parameters, application modes, time functions,
system status and messages for the user. The Medilas D
Family Lasers feature several! operating modes, including
Standard, Fibertom, LITT and LPS. The lasers can be used
in contact or non-contact open surgery with or without
handpieces.

Intended Use: The Dornier Medilas D Family Lasers, specifically the Medias
D LiteBeam, Medilas D LiteBeam +, Medilas D
UroBeam, Medilas D MultiBeam, and Medilas D FlexiPulse
are indicated for use in medicine and surgery, in the following
medical specialties: Urology, Plastic Surgery, General
Surgery, Dermatology, Gynecology, Pulmonary Surgery,
Gastroenterology, ENT, Radiology.
The Dornier Medilas D Family Lasers, specifically the Medias
D LiteBeam, Medilas D LiteBeam +, Medilas D :
UroBeam, Medilas D MultiBeam, and Medilas D FlexiPulse,
are intended for use in cutting, vaporization, ablation and
coagulation of soft tissue in conjunction with endoscopic
equipment (including laparoscopes, hysteroscopes,
bronchoscopes, gastroscopes, cystoscopes, and
colonoscopies), in incision/excision, vaporization, ablation and
coagulation of soft tissue in contact and non-contact open
surgery (with or without a handpiece), in the treatment and/or
removal of vascular lesions (tumors) and removal of
unwanted hair, and for endovascular coagulation of the
greater saphenous vein of the thigh i ients with superficial
vente ae
The Dornier Medilas D Family Lasers, specifically the Medilas
D UroBeam, Medilas D MultiBeam, and Medilas D FlexiPulse,
are intended for use in the treatment of symptoms due to
urinary outflow obstruction secondary to benign prostatic
hyperplasia (BPH) in men over the age of 50 with prostates
with median and/or lateral lobes ranging in fatal valume from
28-85 cc.
Technological From a clinical perspective and comparing design

: Characteristics: specifications, the Dornier Medilas D Family Lasers and the
predicate devices are substantially equivalent. Based on the
technological characteristics and overall performance of the
devices, Dornier MedTech America, Inc. believes that no
significant differences exist between the proposed diode
lasers and the predicate devices.
Dornier MedTech America, Inc. believes the minor differences
of the Medilas D Family Lasers ant its predicates lasers
should not raise any concerns regarding the overall safety or
effectiveness.

Performance Data: While no performance standards have been established for
Diode lasers under Section 514 of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act, the Dornier Medilas D Family Lasers are in
compliance with class IV performance standards for light

emitting products promulgated under the Radiation Control for
Health and Safety Act of 1968. See 21 C.F.R. §1040.10 and
§1040.11. The lasers also comply with the applicable
requirements of the following voluntary standards: IEC 606011, IEC 60601-1-6, IEC 60601-2-22, IEC 60825-1, and
European Medical Device Directive (CE).

Conclusion: Based on the technological characteristics and overall
performance of the devices, Dornier MedTech America, Inc.
believes that the Medilas D Family Lasers and the predicate
devices selected are substantially equivalent and that the
differences between the devices are minor which do not raise
new issues of safety or effectiveness.

Dear Mr. Thomas:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class I (Special Controls) or class I] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
