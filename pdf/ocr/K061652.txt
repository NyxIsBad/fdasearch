Common Name: Lux1540

Classification Name: Laser surgical instrument for use in General and Plastic Surgery
and Dermatology (21 CFR 878.4810)

Product Code: GEX

System Description: The Palomar Lux1540 handpiece is an accessory to the

delivers light with a wavelength of 1540 nm. The complete
system consists of a power source, chiller, a footswitch, and a
handpiece connected to the power unit with an umbilical.

Intended Use: The Palomar Lux1540 handpiece is intended for skin
resurfacing procedures in addition to dermatological
procedures requiring the coagulation of soft tissue.

Performance: Performance data was provided showing the Lux1540 is
capable of performing fractional photothermolysis, ‘e.,
creation of a pattern (lattice) of microscopic islets of damage
at superficial skin layers. The results from the clinical testing
demonstrated that the Lux1540 performs as clinically
intended and that no new issues of safety or effectiveness
were present.

Substantial Equivalence: The Palomar Lux1540 Handpiece is substantially equivalent
to its predicate device when indicated for skin resurfacing.
The data in this application demonstrates that the Palomar
Lux1540 handpiece shares the same indications for use,
similar design features, functional features, and therefore is
substantially equivalent to its predicate devices.

Dear Ms. Timberlake:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for
use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce
prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good
manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply
with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part
807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the
quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product
radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)

to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
