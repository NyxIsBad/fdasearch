Trade Name: MYTHOS 500™ Hair Removal Diode Laser
Classification Name: Laser Instrument, Surgical, powered
Classification: FDA has classified a laser device as a class II device (product code
GEX) and it is reviewed by the General & Plastic Surgery Panel.
Predicate Device: Msq(M?) Ltd. believes that the MYTHOS 500™ Diode Laser
System is substantially equivalent to the LightSheer™ (Coherent
Star) cleared under K00!746 and K003614 in terms of intended use
and indications for use, performance, technological characteristics
and user interface.
Performance Standards: The MYTHOS 500™ Hair Removal Diode Laser complies
with U.S. Federal Performance Standards 21 CFR 1040.10 and 21
CFR 1040.11 for class [V Laser Products.
In addition, the device complies with the European Medical
Directive 93/42/EEC concerning medical devices (Annex II) and
: with the voluntary standards, IEC 60601-1, IEC 60601-1-2, IEC60825-1 and IEC 601-2-22, as described in Section 5.

Intended Use / Indication for Use: The MYTHOS 500™ Hair Removal Diode Laser is
intended for hair removal and permanent hair reduction. The
MYTHOS 500™ System is intended for use on all skin types
(Fitzpatrick skin types I-VI), including tanned skin.
Device Description: The MYTHOS 500™ system delivers pulsed infrared laser light with
a 810nm+10% wavelength and a selectable fluence of 5-60J/cm’.
The system enables two pulse modes: Long pulse and Pulse.
The pulsed energy is delivered through a 10x12mm handpiece tip.
The complete system consists of console and a handpiece connected
to the system by an umbilical cord. The handpiece is pressed against
the patient’s skin and a pulse of laser is delivered. To initiate energy
output the system requires simultaneous activation of the handpiece
trigger and the footswitch. The handpiece tip is cooled to provide
continuous skin cooling. Laser parameters and other system features
are controlled from the Operating Buttons and LCD screen on top of
the console, which provide interface with the system computer.
Substantial Equivalence: There are no unique applications, indications, material or
specifications presented herein. Evidence of equivalence has been
demonstrated through:
¢ The MYTHOS 500™ intended use and indications for use were
previously cleared by FDA for the predicate device (LightSheer).
* The technical characteristics of the MYTHOS 500™ are similar
to those of the LightSheer™.
* Laser output values of the MYTHOS 500™ are well within
previous cleared values of the LightSheer™.
¢ Safety and performance testing.
Therefore, we believe that the MYTHOS 500™ Hair Removal Diode
Laser is substantially equivalent to its predicate device cited above
without raising new safety and/or effectiveness issues.

Dear Mr. Hacohen:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 - Mr. Arava Hacohen .
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Additionally, for questions on the
