4. DESCRIPTION OF THE DEVICE
The SenoRx Biopsy Device is a percutaneous electrosurgical biopsy
device which is indicated for use in providing breast tissue samples for
diagnostic sampling of breast abnormalities under ultrasound guidance.
5. STATEMENT OF INTENDED USE
The SenoRx Biopsy Device System is indicated to provide breast tissue
samples for diagnostic sampling of breast abnormalities. It is intended to
provide breast tissue for histologic examination with partial or complete
removal of the imaged abnormality.
The extent of histologic abnormality cannot be reliably determined from
its mammographic appearance. Therefore the extent of removal of the
imaged evidence of an abnormality does not predict the extent of removal
of a histologic abnormality, e.g., malignancy. When the sampled
abnormality is not histologically benign, it is essential that the tissue
margins be examined for completeness of removal using standard surgical
procedures.
6. COMPARISON WITH PREDICATE DEVICES
The intended use, design, construction, materials and technology are
comparable to the predicate devices.

Dear Ms. Boucly:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CER Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801 and
additionally 21 CFR Part 809.10 for in vitro diagnostic devices), please contact the Office of
Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Additionally, for questions on the promotion and advertising of
your device, please contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4639. Also, please note the
regulation entitled, “Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97).
