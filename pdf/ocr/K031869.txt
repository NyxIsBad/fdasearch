effectors are operated by the handpiece handle. The ring handles may be designed to be
suppressed and released to activate the instruments end-cffector.

The device's insulated shaft may be designed to (depending on the device model and
type) be rotated (up to 360°) either direction (using a knob on the handle.)
Intended Use
The SISS Inc. (d.b.a. MediSISS) Reprocessed clectrosurgical instruments have applicalions ina variety of minimally invasive surgical procedures to manipulate and manage
internal soft tissue by grasping, cutting, and/or to facilitate coagulation, transection, resection, mobilization, and dissections of lissue.
Functional and Safety Testing
Reprocessed Instrument samples underwent bench testing to demonstrate appropriate
functional characteristics. Process validation testing was done to validate the cleaning and
packaging and sterilization procedures. In addition, the manufacturing process includes
visual and functional testing of all products produced.
Summary of Technological Characteristics
The intended use and technological features of the reprocessed devices do not differ from
the legally marketed predicate device(s). Both the reprocessed devices(s) and the predicate device(s) have the same materials and product design. There are no changes to the
claims, intended use, clinical apptications, patient populations. performance specifications, or methods of operation. The technological characteristics of the reprocessed electrosurgical devices are the same as those of the legally marketed predicate devices. The
technological characteristics of the reprocessed electrosurgical device(s) are the same as
those of the legally marketed predicate devices. In addition the MediSISS™! manufieturIng process includes 100% visual and mechanical testing of all products prior to packaging, labeling, and sterilization,
Summary of Performance Data
Performance data demonstrates that the Reprocessed Instruments perform as originally
intended.

MediSISS™ Reprocessed Electrosurgical Instruments undergo mechanical testing to
demonstrate that the parts do not change in function. Process validation testing was done
to validate the cleaning and sterilization procedures as well as the device’s packaging.
Cleaning, sterilization, and packaging validations. functional/performance testing, (product certification,) and (biocompatibility) testing demonstrate that the deviecs are equivalent and continue to be safe and effective for their intended use.
Representative samples of reprocessed electrosurgical instruments underwent bench testing fo demonstrate appropriate functional characteristics. Process validation testing was
: done to validate the cleaning and sterilization procedures as well as the device’s packag
ing. In addition, the manufacturing pracess includes visual and functional testing of all
products produced.
Substantial equivalence has been established with respect to intended use, design. energy
used or delivered, materials, performance. safely, effectiveness, labeling, biocompatibility, standards, and other applicable characteristics. The SISS Inc. (d.b.a. MediSISS)
Reprocessed Electrosurgical Instruments are therefore substantially equivalent to the
identified predicate devices.

Conclusion
Since the Reprocessed Electrosurgical Instruments meet the requirements of the slated
standards and embody technological characteristics substantially equivalent fo the predicale device, we believe the device is safe and effective and performs as well as or better
than the predicate device. The Reprocessed Electrosurgical Instruments will be reprocessed per specifications and QSR good manufacturing practices that ensure the device is
safe and effective for its intended use.
The reprocessed device have the:

* same intended use as the predicate: and

«has the same technological characteristics as the predicate device

¢ and can meet the same performance standards as the predicates
In accordance with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 CFR Part 807 and
based on the information provided in this Premarket notification, SISS Inc. (d.b.a,
McdiSISS) concludes that the modified devices (Reprocessed Electrosurgical Instruments} are safe, effective and substantially equivalent to the predicate devices described
herein.
Based on the information provided herein, the $ LOCK) “Substantial Equivalence” Decision
Making Process Chart, and the PDA “5 10(k) Guidanee Document for General Surgical
Electrosurgical Devices” $/10/95, we conclude that the SISS Inc. (d.b.a. MediSISS) reprocessed electrosurgical instruments are substantially equivalent to the predicate devices
under the Federal Food and Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
This conclusion is based upon the devices’ similarities in functional design, materials.
indications for use, and methods of construction.

Dear Mr. Mouser:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate deviccs marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classificd (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 - Mr. Marc M. Mouser
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
