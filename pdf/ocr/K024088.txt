Name of Device and Name/Address of Sponsor
Ceralas D Diode Laser System with Endo Laser Vein System Kit
biolitec, Inc.
515 Shaker Road
East Longmeadow, Massachusetts 01028 :
Classification Name
Surgical laser and accessories
Predicate Devices
Ceralas D Diode Laser System (980 nm and 810 nm)
Intended Use/Indication for Use
The device is intended for endovascular coagulation of blood vessels. The device is
indicated for the endovascular coagulation of the greater saphenous vein in the
thigh in patients with superficial vein reflux.
Technological Characteristics
The Ceralas D 980 nm Laser with Endo Laser Vein System Kit consists of the
cleared Ceralas D 980 and the ELVeS. Twelve versions of the ELVeS kit contain
various combinations of the following components: (1) 19 gauge needle; (2) 21 gauge
needle; (3) 5 French (F) introducer sheath; (4) 5 F introducer sheath/dilator; (5) a
0.035” J-tip guidewire; (6) a 0.018” J-tip guidewire; (7) surgical drape; (8) surgical
tape; and (9) a surgical pen.

Performance Data
The device complies with the following voluntary consensus standards: 21 C.F.R.
§§ 1040.10 & 1040.11; ANSI/AAMI ES1; IEC 601-1; IEC 601-2-22; EN 60825-1, and
ANSI/AAMI/ISO 10993-7.
Substantial Equivalence
The Ceralas D 980 nm Laser System with ELVeS has the same intended use and
indications for use as the cleared Ceralas D 980 nm Laser System and Ceralas D
810 nm Diode Laser System and the same technological characteristics as the
cleared Ceralas D 810 and the cleared Ceralas D 980. The technological differences
between the Ceralas D 980 with ELVeS kit and the cleared Ceralas D 980 is the
addition of the ELVeS kit, which is cleared for use with the Ceralas D 810 for the
same indication. Thus, the ELVeS kit is not a new technological characteristic for
diode lasers for endovascular coagulation of the greater saphenous vein in the thigh
in patients with superficial vein reflux. Thus, the Ceralas D 980 with ELVeS is
substantially equivalent to its predicate devices.

Dear Mr. Kahan:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for
use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce
prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good
manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class Ii (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply
with all the Act’s requirements, including. but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR
Part 807); labeling (21 CIR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in

: Page 2,- Mr. Jonathan S. Kahan- / : Lo a
. the quality systems (QS) regulation Q I CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product,
‘radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050. . :
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
: marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device

to proceed to the market. :
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (24 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Additionally, for questions on the: promotion
