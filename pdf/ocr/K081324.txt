Lasers
Common Name: Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser
: Classification Name: Laser Surgical Instrument, for use in General and
Plastic Surgery and Dermatology
Classification Regulation: 21 CFR § 878.4810
Device Classification: ll
Identification of Predicate Device
Predicate Device(s): Candela Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser, K073534
Candela 3630 Laser System (Alexandrite) KO63074
Cynosure Accolade Elite Laser (Alexandrite) KO72868
Device Description
The Candela Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser consists of an Alexandrite laser head, power
supply and deionized water circulator The laser head contains cavity mirrors, pockels
cell, solid state laser medium (the Alexandrite rod), and two high intensity xenon
flashlamps which excite the laser medium. A calibration port with an internal meter is
located on the control panel, which is used to verify the transmission of the optical fiber
and handpiece, and to calibrate the output of the handpiece at selected fluence levels.
The temperature of the laser head is regulated by the circulation of distilled water at a
controlled temperature.
The Candela Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser delivers laser energy at a wavelength of 755
nm and pulse duration between 50 and 120 microseconds. When the Q-switching
mechanism is disabled the system has the capability of producing a laser pulse duration
of 0.050 - 0.120 milliseconds. The output of this laser is delivered to the area of
treatment by means of a lens coupled user replaceable optical fiber with a treatment
Page 20 / 156

handpiece attached to its distal end. A trigger switch is used to control the delivery of
pulses.
A microprocessor based system controller is used to monitor and direct all system
functions. Users of the laser select parameters such as desired energy density (fluence)
level and repetition rate and monitor operation via electronic controls and a display
panel. The control panel is also used to enable or disable the triggering of the laser, to
initiate the calibration feature and to obtain feedback from the system, such as the
number of pulses delivered or spot size selected. The Candela Q-Switched Alexandrite
Laser supports 2mm, 3mm, and 5mm nominal spot sizes.
Description of Intended Use
The Candela Family of Q-Switched Alexandrite Lasers are indicated for treatment in the
following uses:
Pigmented Lesions
Tattoos
Rationale for Substantial Equivalence
The Candela Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser has the same intended use, utilizes similar
functional features (including power output, spot size, repetition rate, energy, and
fluence) and matches key design aspects (including wavelength, light generation
medium, power supply, cooling and controls system) , as the predicate devices.
The Candela Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser shares similar methods of assembly,
method of operation, and intended uses, and therefore is substantially equivalent to the
current legally marketed Candela Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser KO73534, Candela 3630
Laser Systems, Alexandrite, K063074 and Cynosure Apogee Elite Laser, Alexandrite,
K034030 predicate devices. .
Safety and Effectiveness Information
Candela believes that there are no new questions of safety or effectiveness raised and
the Candela Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser is substantially equivalent to the current
legally marketed Candela Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser, KO73534, Candela 3630 Laser
System (Alexandrite) KO63074, and Cynosure Apogee Elite Laser (Alexandrite)
K034030 predicate devices in intended use and technological features and therefore the
risks and benefits are comparable to the predicate devices.
Conclusion
Based on the similarities in indications for use, design features, and functional features,
the Candela Q-Switched Alexandrite Laser has been shown to be substantially
equivalent to the current legally marketed predicate devices.

Dear Ms. LaCroix:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device.on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health's (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance. at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance
