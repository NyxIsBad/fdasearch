c. Description of Device
The Estech Cobra Surgical System is a family of devices including RF Ablation Probes,
with either a malleable or flexible shafts, used in conjunction with the Cobra
Electrosurgical Unit (ESU) and other accessories, including the Estech Cobra Bipolar
Recording Electrode. The System is intended for use by surgeons for the coagulation of
cardiac and soft tissues during open surgical procedures.
d. Intended Use
‘The intended use for the Estech Cobra Surgical System is as follows:
The Estech Cobra Surgical System is intended for the coagulation of cardiac tissue using
radiofrequency (RF) energy during cardiac surgery. The System can be used during

general surgery to coagulate soft tissues. The System may also be used to coagulate
blood and soft tissue to produce hemostasis.
e. Comparison to Predicate Device
The XL version of the Estech Cobra Surgical System is substantially equivalent in
intended use, technology, design and materials to the predicate device. The XL version
has up to seventeen electrodes on the ablation probe. The original premarket notification
device had an upper limit of seven electrodes. The Stabilizers differ in size and handle
configuration. The XL version has an Introducer to facilitate the placement of the
System.
The Estech Cobra Surgical Probe is substantially equivalent in intended use, technology,
design and materials to the predicate system. The Cobra Surgical Probe does not have
the capability for a cooling stream of water to be run through the shaft and it does not
interface with a Stabilizer. This version of the Cobra Surgical Probe is identical to the
Boston Scientific Electrosurgical Probe.
The Estech Cobra Bipolar Recording Electrode is substantially equivalent to the surgical
intended use, sensing and pacing characteristics of the predicate device. Both are handheld devices that are intended to be used only in an open surgical field. They are not
implantable.
f{. Summary of Supporting Data
No biocompatibility data is necessary since the materials in the modified ablation probes
(XL and Surgical Probe) are identical to those described in the predicate 510(k)s. The
materials of the Recording Electrode are identical to those in the ablation probes.
Preclinical performance data is supplied to demonstrate that the XL version of the cooled
Estech Cobra Adhere Ablation Probe met the same pertinent specifications as the
predicate version. .
No performance data is necessary for the Estech Cobra Surgical Probe since it is identical
in design, materials and manufacture to the predicate device.
Preclinical performance data is supplied to demonstrate that the Estech Cobra Bipolar
Recording Electrode operates as intended.
Additionally, Estech certifies that the accessories are in compliance with the pertinent
sections of the FDA consensus standard, AAMI/ ANSI HF-18: Electrosurgical devices.

Dear Mr. Coombs:
This letter corrects our substantially equivalent letter of September 13, 2005.
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices,
good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA),
it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be
found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to continue marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your
device to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0120. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
