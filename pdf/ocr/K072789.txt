Description of Devices;
The AEM Disposable Electrode and the AEM Disposable Handpiece connect to a compatible
electrosurgical generator via an adapter on the ENCISION AEM Monitor. The handpiece has foot
switching and hand switching versions. The electrodes and handpieces are single use products,
which are provided sterile. They are designed not to be re-sterilized.
The AEM Monitoring System, including the electrodes and handpieces, are designed to minimize
the likelihood of stray energy injuries caused by active insulation failure or capacitive coupling.
The monitor does this by shutting down the ESU when excessive current is returned via the shield
circuit which extends to near the tip of the electrode.
The electrodes, which consist of an insulated tip, shaft with locking knob, and AEM shield
assembly, are available in various tip styles. The electrode has an inner insulation between the
active conductor and shield tube, as wel] as a secondary outer insulation on the outside of the
electrode shaft. The electrodes snap into the handpiece.
One version of the handpiece provides switching for the Cut and Coag functions of the ESU, This
version has an integral cord. The other version uses foot-switching provided with the
electrosurgical generator. The foot-switching handpiece connects to either the existing reusable or
disposable AEM Cord from Encision. The electrodes may be removed from the handpiece and
replaced with another electrode within the sterile field.
The electrode can rotate freely or be locked in one of multiple orientations relative to the
handpiece, as preferred by the surgeon.
Intended Use:
AEM Disposable Electrodes and AEM Disposable Handpieces are electrosurgical
accessories intended, by use of monopolar high-frequency electrical current from
compatible electrosurgical generators, for ablation, removal, resection and coagulation of
soft tissue where associated hemostasis is required in open, endoscopic and laparoscopic
surgical procedures.
The devices are intended for use by qualified medical personnel trained in the use of
electrosurgical equipment.
AEM instruments incorporate the use of AEM technology and are intended for use with the
Encision AEM Monitoring System and electrosurgical generators having compatibility with the
AEM Monitor.
Technological Characteristics:
The Encision AEM Disposable Electrodes and AEM Disposable Handpieces incorporate the
same technological characteristics as the predicate devices for delivery of the ESU high
frequency current, consisting of insulated conductors and shafts with appropriately shaped tips for
electrosurgery. The control for ESU Cut and Coag modes on the handswitching handpiece is a
switch similar in design and function to the predicate handpiece.
Like the Encision predicate devices, the AEM Disposable Electrodes and AEM Disposabie
Handpieces include an additional AEM shielding function which diverts stray energy from the
shaft of the instrument and is monitored by the Encision AEM Monitor.
Non-clinical Performance Testing:
Performance of the devices’ AEM technology and delivery of electrosurgical energy has been
verified by bench testing consisting of continuity and capacitance measurements, and

compatibility testing with a worst case representative electrosurgical generator and the AEM
Monitor.
Conclusions:
The AEM Disposable Electrodes and AEM Disposable Handpieces are safe and effective and are
substantially equivalent to the predicate devices.

Dated: September 28, 2007
Received: October 1, 2007 ;
Dear Mr. Lehtonen:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
cece adulteration... - -—-— ————— ——_- fe a
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 — Mr. Daniel W. Lehtonen
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 5 10(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
“Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
