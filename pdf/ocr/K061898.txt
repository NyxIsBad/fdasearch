Device Description:
The EZLase™ dental diode laser system may be used to perform various soft
tissue dental applications. The system uses advanced laser technology to
incise, excise, vaporize, coagulate and ablate intra-oral soft tissues. A Gallium
Aluminum Arsenide (GaAlAs) and/or an Indium Gallium Arsenide
Phosphorous solid-state laser diode emit infrared laser energy to the various
oral soft tissues targeted during procedure. This energy is transmitted via a
flexible fiberoptic cable to the handpiece that emits the energy to the targeted
tissue site. A visible light is emitted at the same time to visually pinpoint the
treatment location. The power output and pulse width may be adjusted to
specific user requirements.

Contraindications:

6.6.1 All clinical procedures performed with EZLase™ must be subjected to the
same clinical judgment and care as with traditional techniques. Patient
risk must always be considered and fully understood before clinical
treatment. The clinician must completely understand the patient's medical
history prior to treatment. Exercise caution for general medical conditions
that might contraindicate a local procedure. Such conditions may include
allergy to local or topical anesthetics, heart disease, lung disease, bleeding
disorders, sleep apnea, an immune system deficiency and other such
conditions. Medical clearance from patient's physician is advisable when
doubt exists regarding treatment.

Substantial Equivalence:

There are no unique applications, indications, materials or specifications
presented herein. All the submitted indications for use retain the same
meaning as their equivalent indications cleared by the FDA in the following
510k clearances: K030539 for LaserSmile™, K041721 for LVI Lase and
K050274 for DioDent I.

Conclusion:

EZLase™ is substantially equivalent to dental products previously cleared for
marketing. EZLase™ performs the same indications for use through the same
mechanism as the other cleared devices. Evidence of equivalence has been
demonstrated through the following:

Dear Ms. Rizoiu:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for
use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce
prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that
have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good
manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class HI (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply
with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part
807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the
quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product
radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 — Ms. Ioana M. Rizoiu
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain other
general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
(240) 276-3150 or at its Internet address http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/industry/support/index.html.
