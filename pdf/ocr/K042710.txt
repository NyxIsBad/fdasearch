2. Device name and classification:
2.1 Device Name: Surgitron Radiolase II
2.2 Classification: Class II device, 21 CFR 878.4400
3. Description of the device:
The ellmman Surgitron Radiolase II is a high frequency, medium power output
electrosurgical medical device. The design is similar to currently marketed ellman
electrosurgical generators and provides the essential operational modes that are most
often used in medium power electrosurgical applications. The unit consists of both a
nominal 50 Watt maximum output power in monopolar mode and a nominal 55 Watt
maximum output power in bipolar mode, providing the capability of precision cutting,
coagulation, and hemostasis in a four megacycle frequency electrical current. The unit is
designed to comply with the international safety standards.
4. The intended use/indication for use of the device:
4.1 Cutting
Skin Incisions, Biopsy, Cysts, Abscesses, Tumors, Cosmetic Repairs, Development of
Skin Flaps, SkinTags, Nevi, Keratosis, Oculoplastic Procedures, Blepharoplasty,
Aponeurotic Repair, Levator Resection, Arthroscopic Procedures
4.2 Blended Cutting and Coagulation
Skin Tags, Papilloma Keloids, Keratosis, Verrucae, Basal Cell Carcinoma, Nevi,
Fistulas, Epithelioma, Cosmetic Repairs, Cysts, Abscesses, Development of Skin Flaps,
Oculoplastic Procedures, Arthroscopic Procedures, ENT procedures
4.3 Hemostasis
Control of Bleeding, Epilation, Telangiectasia

Trade/Device Name: Surgitron Radiolase Il
Regulation Number: 21 CFR 878.4400
Regulation Name: Electrosurgical cutting and coagulation device and accessories
Regulatory Class: II
Product Code: GEI
Dated: February 10, 2005
Received: February 11, 2005
Dear Mr. Garito:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class Il (Special Controls) or class iI] (PMA),
it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device
can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA
may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing QI
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 — Mr. Jon Garito
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your
device to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0120. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Smail
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
