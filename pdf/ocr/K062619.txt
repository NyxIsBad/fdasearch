Legally Marketed Predicate Devices for Substantial Equivalence:
Odyssey 2.4G Diode Laser, manufactured by Ivoclar Vivadent, Inc. (K050453)
Ceralas D 810 Diode Laser, manufactured by Biolitec, Inc. (K032864)
Aurora SL Diode Laser, manufactured by Premier Laser Systems, Inc. (K993285)
Rationale for Substantial Equivalence:

The aforementioned laser devices and their accompanying delivery systems share
similar indications for use on soft tissue with the submitted device for cutting soft tissue,
affecting lesions, and photocoagulation. The predicate devices and submitted device
share similar design features including wavelength, operating controls, and laser delivery
method. The devices share similar methods of control systems, safety features, and
performance monitoring. The devices share similar performance specifications including
power output and energy type. The devices share similar applications to soft tissue.
Description of Submitted Device:

The DenLaser 800 Plus is a device for delivering laser energy to human soft tissue
for a variety of surgical procedures. This energy is generated by solid-state diodes, which
provide a consistent and reliable generation of laser energy at 810 + 20nm fora
maximum of 5 watts of energy output. The laser energy is delivered to surgical site by
means of a proprietary optical fiber system, which allows for the safe transmission of
laser energy to the site without creating undue risk to the patient or operatory staff by

errant or collateral laser emissions. The device features some user definable settings,
including a switchable 630nm aiming beam, adjustable power output for both the
working beam and aiming beam, and continuous delivery or pulse delivery option.

The working end of the delivery fiber is contained within metal handpiece with a
disposable single-use tip. This handpiece system is provided with the device. The
activation of the working beam diodes is completed by use of a foot-actuated switch.
Intended Uses of the DenLaser 800 Plus diode laser system:

The device is intended to be used for a variety of surgical procedures on soft
tissue. See Indications for Use on page 2-1.

Technological Characteristics and Substantial Equivalence:

The Odyssey 2.4G Diode Laser uses solid state diodes to generate laser energy in
the 810nm range. This system uses a fiber delivery system to transmit laser energy to the
surgical site. The system also features a 630nm aiming beam and features controls that
allow for adjusting the output of the working beam, and switching between a continuous
or pulsed-mode laser emission. The device features a wireless foot switch for actuating
the working beam. The maximum output of the working beam is 5 watts.

The Ceralas D 810 Diode Laser uses solid state diodes to generate laser energy in
the 810nm range. This system uses a fiber delivery system to transmit laser energy to the
surgical site. The system also features a 635nm aiming beam and features controls that
allow for adjusting the output of the working beam, and switching between a continuous
or pulsed-mode laser emission. The maximum output of the unit is 15 watts.

The Aurora SL Diode Laser uses solid state diodes to generate laser energy in the
810nm range. This system uses a fiber delivery system to transmit laser energy to the
surgical site. The system also features a 630-680nm aiming beam and features controls

that allow for adjusting the output of the working beam. The maximum output of the unit
is 6 watts.
Performance Standards:

The DenLaser 800 Plus diode laser complies with the performance requirements
of 21 CFR 1040.10 and 1040.11, with permissible deviations relative to Laser Notice 50,
dated July 26, 2001. The device also complies with IEC 60601-1 :1998+A1, IEC 606012-22:1995, IEC 60825-1:1993+A1+A2, 47 CFR 15 and 18, and ETSI 301-489-1.

See Part 7: Performance Data
Conclusion

The DenLaser 800 Plus is substantially equivalent to the listed laser surgical
devices without raising any issues of safety or effectiveness. This device shares similar
intended uses, and similar functional and performance characteristics. The device is
designed to comply with relevant federal and international safety and performance
standards.

Trade/Device Name: DenLaser 800 Plus
Regulation Number: 21 CFR 878.4810
Regulation Name: Laser surgical instrument for use in general and plastic surgery
and in dermatology
Regulatory Class: II
Product Code: GEX
Dated: August 15, 2006
Received: September 6, 2006
Dear Mr. Larsen:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the Division of Small
Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free number (800) 638-2041 or
