———— oy * 4

Indications include Esophageal Ulcers, Mallory-Weiss tears, Arteriovenous
Malformations, Angiomata, Barrett’s Esophagus, Dieulafoy Lesions, and
Angiodysplasia.

Technological Characteristics

The HALO? consists of a Generator; a Sizing Catheter; a Coagulation Catheter;
and a Catheter Connection Cable. A mains power cord and optional footswitch also
are available. The HALO%° technological characteristics and principles of
operation are identical to those of the cleared Stellartech Coagulation System 2.
Performance Data

The HALO2 System is technologically identical to the cleared Stellartech
Coagulation System. Accordingly, no performance testing was conducted. Clinical
data were provided to FDA to support the Physician’s Instructions contained in the
Instructions for Use for the HALO Coagulation Catheter. That data
demonstrated that, when used in accordance with those instructions, the HALO260
is at least as safe and effective as the Stellartech Coagulation System for the
treatment of Barrett’s Esophagus.

Substantial Equivalence

The HALO2 is as safe and effective as the Stellartech Coagulation System. The
HALO369 has the same intended use, indications for use, technological
characteristics, and principles of operation as the predicate device. The addition of
Physician’s Instructions recommending specific power settings for the treatment of
Barrett’s Esophagus (a cleared indication for use of the predicate device) is
supported by clinical data and does not change the device’s indications for use.
Thus, the HALO is substantially equivalent.

Dear Mr. Kahan:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class I] (Special Controls) or class II] (PMA),
it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device
can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA
may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
