Contact Person: Lorraine Calzetta Patrovic
Date prepared: April 23, 2004
Classification: Class II (21 CFR § 878.4810 Laser Surgical Instrument for use in General
and Plastic Surgery and in Dermatology)
Common Name: Dermatology Laser, Smoothbeam Laser System
Predicate Devices: Candela Smoothbeam 1450 nm Diode Laser System (K013825 ,K030834)
The Diode laser is a Continuous Wave, diode medical laser, controlled by an embedded processor, to be used
for use in dermatology for the treatment of wrinkles. The Candela Smoothbeam Laser System is comprised of a
power supply, optical delivery system, software control system and Dynamic Cooling Device. The laser output
energy is delivered via an optical fiber to a handpiece, which produces circular beams on the skin. The Dynamic
Cooling Device, provides a short burst of cryogen spray during the laser treatment. The cryogen is delivered via
a hose to a nozzle located in the handpiece. The Dynamic Cooling Device functions to cool the skin during the
laser treatment minimizing thermal damage to skin during laser treatment and reducing pain associated with
laser treatment.
The Candela Smoothbeam Laser System is equipped with safety interlock systems to protect patients and
operators. Users of the device, make selections from a control panel to regulate operation during the laser
treatment.
Testing:
Asa laser product, the Smoothbeam Laser System is required to conform and does conform to the Laser
Performance Standard (21 CFR 1040). In addition, the device will conform to the UL 2601 Electrical Safety
Standard and with the Harmonized Standard EN 60601-1-2, Part 2 established by the European Community.
Safety and Effectiveness Information:
The modality of action for the treatment of sebaceous hyperplasia is similar to that of previously cleared
indications in the treatment of back acne and the treatment of inflammatory acne vulgaris. Published clinical
data, using t he predicate Smoothbeam Laser, cleared for use in the market, produced results that demonstrate
that the Smoothbeam Laser is safe and effective for the expanded indication,- the treatment of sebaceous
hyperplasia
Summary of Substantial Equivalence:
The Candela Smoothbeam Laser System described in this submission is identical to the currently marketed
Candela Smoothbeam Laser System based on operating principles, materials, mechanism of action, design,
construction and intended use. Candela believes that the Smoothbeam Laser is substantially equivalent to the
predicate device.
