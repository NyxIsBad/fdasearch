Device Description-parts and function/concept: The Reprocessed SUD (Reprocessed
Used, Disposable Endoscopic Scissors and Graspers) is a sterilized SUD. The
reprocessed Endopath endoscopic instruments are sterile, single patient use
instruments that have a rotating insulated shaft and are designed for use through
appropriate surgical trocars. The rotation knob located on the handle rotates the shaft
360 degrees in either direction. Some instruments have a monopolar cautery
connector extending from the top of the handle and can be used for electosurgery
when properly attached to standard cautery cables and appropriate generators. Other
instruments have rachet handles, which allow the instrument jaws to be locked in 3-2
place. The instrument jaws or scissor blades are activated by compression and Pa
release of the ring handles. See instructions for use for complete mode of operation

Dear Mr. Kovacs:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
’ devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class IJ (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

to proceed to the market. ;
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
