Intended Use / Indications for Use
The ClearLight Phototherapy System is intended to provide
phototherapeutic light to the body. The ClearLight is generally
indicated to treat dermatological conditions. The ClearLight is
specifically indicated to treat moderate inflammatory acne vulgaris.

Technological Characteristics
The ClearLight Therapy System is a high intensity lamp intended for
the therapy of dermatological disorders such as acne vulgaris by
emitting visible light in the violet-blue range with fluency of light
ranging between 50-200 mW/cm2. The system includes a spectral band
light source with spectral emittance concentrated in the violet/blue
spectral band and an optical system for controlling spectra and beam
parameters of the light source. It also includes a mechanical fixture for
holding the light source at an adjustable distance and direction related
to the skin treatment area, an electronic unit to control the duration,
and power of the emitted radiation and to capture and store patient
data via a touch sereen (i.e., control console), and a camera for :
capturing digital images.

Performance Data
The preclinical testing includes Electrical Safety and EMC testing,
including the requirements of IEC 60601-1 “Medical Electrical
Equipment Part 1 - General Requirements for Safety” and was tested
in accordance to Medical Directive 93/42/EEC — EN 55011: 1998 +
A1(99), Class A and IEC 60601-1-2 “Collateral Standard: Medical
Electrical Equipment Electromagnetic Compatibility - Requirements
and Tests.” ANSI/ESNA RP-27 1-96 Recommended Practice for
Photobiological Safety for Lamps and Lamp Systems — General
Requirements ANSI/ESNA RP-27.3-96 Recommended Practice for
Photobiological Safety for Lamps — Risk Group Classification Labeling.
In vitro testing demonstrated that exposure to high intensity narrow
band light induced eradication of p. acnes by endogenic porphyrins.
Clinical data from the trial of the ClearLight device for the treatment of
dermatological conditions supports substantial equivalence and demonstrates
that the ClearLight device is safe and effective for the treatment of acne
vulgaris.

Substantial Equivalence
CureLight’s ClearLight is substantially equivalent to other legally marketed
Ultraviolet Dermatological Light devices. The ClearLight has the same
intended use and general indications for use, and similar principles of
operation and technological characteristics as the previously cleared
predicate Avex Industries Ltd.’s Phototherapeutix devices; National
Biological Corporation’s Derma-Wand; PhotoMedex, Inc.’s XTrac Excimer
Laser System, Model AL 7000; and Respironics Inc.’s Wallaby 3 Phototherapy
System. In addition, the ClearLight’s specific indication for use in subsumed
within the general indications for use and encompassed by the specific
indications for use of its predicate devices.
The ClearLight and its predicate devices are all light device that are
used to treat dermatological conditions by exposing the surface of the
skin to light at precise wavelengths. Although there are differences in
the technological characteristics of the ClearLight and its predicate
devices, those differences do not raise new questions of safety or
efficacy. Thus, the ClearLight is substantially equivalent.
