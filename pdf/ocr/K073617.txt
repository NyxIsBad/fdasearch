5-2. DEVICE DESCRIPTION
The medical device PHARAON LIPO is based on the use of a laser module allowing the
emission of a beam of coherent light at 970nm + 10 nm at a maximum power of 25W. The
laser module consists of laser diodes assembled in series and optically aligned in order to
focus in an optical fiber of 600um. The optical fiber is screwed onto the SMA 905 connector of
the laser module. The apparatus PHARAON LIPO includes the whole of the supplies necessary
to supply the laser (SOA, 2V) and to ensure its thermalisation using a Peltier element built on
a ventilated radiator.
In addition PHARAON LIPO includes the whole of electronics and the functions allowing the
parameter setting of the laser and the safe functioning of the device. The adjustments of the
parameters are done using a TFT screen and a tactile flagstone.
5-3. INTENDED USE
PHARAON LIPO is intended for laser assisted lipolysis
5 - 4, PERFORMANCE DATA
PHARAON LIPO conforms to Guidance on the content and organization of a premarket
notification for a medical laser (June 1995) and to Guidance for the Content of Premarket
Submissions for Software Contained in Medical Devices (May 2005).
PHARAON LIPO conforms to 21CFR part 1040.10 and 1040.11.
Performance data demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of PHARAON LIPO for its intended
use.
5 - 5. SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE

Dear Pr Jaouad Zemmouri:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class II (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health's (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, “Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474, For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
‘ (Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems

at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance
