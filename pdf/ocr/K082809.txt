c. PREDICATE DEVICES NAMES:
Trade Name(s): \) Sharplan Models 20C, 30C and 40C CO2 Laser (K963229)
2) UtraPulse SurgiTouch CO2 Laser Systems (K030147)
D. DEVICE DESCRIPTION:
The AcuPulse 30 and 40 series is the next generation of Lumenis CO2 lasers. The new product
will retain the same console, articulated arm, delivery devices and other basic features of the
current Compact 20C, 30C & 40C series, while integrating improved versions of the GUI and
SurgiTouch scanner currently used with the UltraPulse SurgiTouch.
The AcuPulse 30 and 40 Carbon Dioxide Laser is an advanced computer-controlled, user friendly
CO2 laser system based on a sealed-off CO2 laser tube providing up to 30 or
40 Watts (model dependent) on tissue. The system incorporates the CO2 laser tube within the
main cabinet, an articulated arm beam delivery system and attachable laser accessories. The
system is activated for laser emission by a footswitch.
This system incorporates a DC-excited CO2 laser tube, The CO2 laser wavelength falls in the
mid-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. This wavelength is invisible to the human
eye. CO2 laser energy is readily absorbed by water in tissue. Since soft tissue is comprised
primarily of water, CO2 laser energy can be used effectively for the excision, incision, ablation,
vaporization and coagulation of soft tissue

The principles of operation and fundamental scientific technology are the same for the subject
devices and predicate devices.
E. INTENDED USE:

coagulation of soft tissue in the surgical specialties of: ENT, Gynecology, Laparoscopic Surgery

Dear Frances E. Harrison:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
