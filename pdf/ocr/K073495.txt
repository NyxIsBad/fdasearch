Device Description
. The Aquamantys Malleable Bipolar Sealer is similar to the Aquamantys 6.0 Bipolar Sealer, cleared via
K#0528559, in that they are comprised of a pencil-grip handle which houses an electrode terminating at the
distal tip. The Aquamantys Malleable Bipolar Sealer is constructed of the same medical device grade
materials as the Aquamantys 6.0 except for the LED light circuit and over molded shaft. All
biocompatibility data is on file at TissueLink Medical, Inc. A summary is included in Section 5 of this
submission. The manufacture of both devices is similar, consisting of an electrode tip/shaft assembly
extending out of an ergonomically designed clamshell body. Both devices have two parallel (along the
axis of symmetry) electrodes stemming from the handle that are approximately 4-6 millimeters apart.
Both devices are electrically insulated, leaving only the tip of each shaft electrically active.

Like the Aquamantys 6.0 Bipolar Sealer, each tip of the Aquamantys Malleable is a smooth stainless steel
cylinder with a hemispherical end. Each tip is set at a downward angle between 0° - 45° along the long
axis of the device. The Aquamantys 6.0 device has a slot located on each tip oriented lateral to the handle
towards the outside of the device, allowing saline to flow from the inner lumen of the hypotube to the
electrode. The Aquamantys Malleable device incorporates a hole instead of a slot, similarly oriented
lateral to the handle towards the outside of the device. The saline wets the outer surface of the stainless
steel electrode tip in a manner identical to the Aquamantys 6.0 Bipolar Sealer. The device is not intended
fof use without saline.
Ten (10) feet of saline tubing and electrical cord are routed distally from the handle. The distal end of the
disposable electrica] cord contains a standard three (3) prong paddle plug for connection to the
Aquamantys Pump Generator System. The saline tubing is connected to an I.V. pump segment. The LV.
pump segment contains a 6” pump tubing portion for loading into the Aquamantys Pump portion of the
Aquamantys Pump Generator System and a Drip Chamber/spike set for connection to the saline delivery
source.
The simultaneous application of saline irrigation and radio-frequency energy allows coagulation of
bleeding tissue at much lower temperatures than conventional dry radiofrequency coagulation. This
prevents the formation of surface eschar. Most conventional electrosurgical devices create a surface
eschar that is hard and scab-like.
The Aquamantys Malleable Bipolar Sealer has an optional illumination provided by a LED light
positioned between the electrodes at the distal end of the device. It can be switched on or off with a
button located on the handpiece and is used to illuminate the surgical site if needed.
The Aquamantys Malleable Bipolar Sealer also incorporates a malleable shaft that can be bent by the user
into various positions,while maintaining the functionality as identified in the product specifications.

Intended Use:
The Aquamantys single-use disposable Malleable Bipolar Sealer with Light
is a Sterile, bipolar electrosurgical device intended to be used in conjunction
with the Aquamantys Pump Generator for delivery of RF energy and saline for
hemostatic sealing and coagulation of soft tissue and bone at the operative
site. It is intended for, but not limited to orthopaedic, spine, thoracic, and
open abdominal surgery. The device is not intended for contraceptive tubal
coagulation (permanent female sterilization).
Contraindications:
The efficacy of the Aquamantys Malleable Bipolar Sealer with Light device for contraceptive tubal
coagulation (permanent female sterilization) has not been evaluated and is not known.
Technological Characteristics:
The Aquamantys Malleable Bipolar Sealer with Light electrosurgical device shares the same fundamental
technology as predicate device, the Aquamantys 6.0 Bipolar Sealer. The technology is based on
simultaneous saline irrigation and RF power delivery. Both devices operate in conjunction with the
Aquamantys Pump Generator. No modifications to the Aquamantys Pump Generator software are
required for the use of the Aquamantys Malleable Bipolar Sealer with Light.
Nonclinical Performance:
The performance characteristics of the Aquamantys Malleable Bipolar Sealer with Light were tested and
compared with performance specifications established by TissueLink Medical, Inc. for the device.
Clinical Performance:
Clinical testing was not performed on these devices.

Dear Som Kowvuri:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

Page 2 —-Som Kovvuri /
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
