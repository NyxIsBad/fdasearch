Endovenous Occlusion of the Greater Saphenous Vein in Patients
with Superficial Vein Reflux
Indicated for use with the ELVes Procedure Kit in the endovascular
coagulation of the Greater Saphenous Vein (GSV) of the thigh in patients
with Superficial Vein Reflux.

Technological Characteristics
The Ceralas D100 for vaporization of the prostate to treat BPH has the
same technological characteristics as the cleared Ceralas D100 and
substantially similar technological characteristics as compared to the
INTERmedic Diode Laser.
Performance Data

Performance testing of the Ceralas D100 demonstrates no significant
difference as compared to the cleared Ceralas D100 device (K050824).
Thus, the performance and safety testing obtained for the cleared Ceralas
D100 is fully applicable to the Ceralas D100.

Substantial Equivalence
The Ceralas D100 is as safe and effective as Biolitec’s 100W Ceralas D
980nm Diode Laser (K050824) and INTERmedic’s Diode Laser Family
890nm and 980nm (K053540). The Ceralas D100 has the same intended
uses and similar indications, technological characteristics, and principles
of operation as its predicate devices. The minor technological differences
between the Ceralas D100 and its predicate devices raise no new issues of
safety or effectiveness. Performance data demonstrate that the Ceralas
D100 is as safe and effective as the predicate devices. Thus, the Ceralas
D100 is substantially equivalent.

Dear Mr. Kahan:
This letter corrects our substantially equivalent letter of May 16, 2007.
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval (PMA). You may,
therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The general
controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices,
good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class HI (PMA),
it may be subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be
found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Page 2 - Mr. Jonathan S. Kahan
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to continue marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your
device to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0120. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
