(of the Summary)
Device Name: Aramis If Dermatological Laser
Common Name: — Er:Glass Laser
Classification Laser surgical instrument for use in general and plastic surgery and in
Name: dermatology (see: 21 CFR 878.4810).
Product Code: GEX
Panel: 79
Predicate devices: The Aramis laser (also Aramis I) - K012545 and K002649
The New Star Model 130 - K962791
The Smoothbeam Laser System - K013825
The CoolTouch and CoolTouch I - K003715
Device description: The Aramis II Dermatological Laser emits a beam of coherent light at 1540
microns which is delivered to the hand pieces, including a cooling hand
piece, through a fiber optic.

Indications: The Aramis II Dermatological Laser system is intended to be used for
incision/excision, ablation, and coagulation (homeostasis) of soft tissue. The
Aramis II laser is also indicated for the removal of pigmented lesions;
photocoagulation of dermatological vascular lesions, including
photothermolysis of blood vessels (treatment of facial and leg veins), and for
the treatment of periorbital and perioral wrinkles.

The Aramis Dermatological Laser is also labeled: “CAUTION: Federal law
restricts the sale to or use by licensed professionals.”

Performance Data: The results of pre-clinical and clinical studies were included.

A study of skin remodeling in hairless rats demonstrated that results are dose
and temperature cooling dependent. Further, the thermal effects need to be
controlled to reduce the risks of injury to the epidermis. Histological results
showed new collagen synthesis and marked fibroblastic proliferation.
Three clinical studies in a total of 76 patients. All doses were administered
in pulse trains and a cooling hand piece was used to cool the epidermis
before treatment.
One clinical investigation was a dose-response study in 10 patients. The
researchers reported some erythema, swelling, blistering, and crusting at
higher doses. The researchers reported that lower doses should be
administered to the periorbital area due to increased risk of side effects in this
area.
Researchers in the other two clinical investigations reported results on 66
patients. In one study patients for followed for 6 months after the 3"
treatment; in the other they were followed for 14 months. The researchers
reported there were no or only a low incidence of complications, such as
pain, swelling, erythema, scabbing, or blisters. Both the periorbital and
perioral areas were treated in these investigations.
Scheduled follow-ups in these two investigations, showed progressive
improvement of the skin texture and the wrinkles. There were no unwanted
side effects except for a brief erythema linked to the cooling. In one study
biopsies were taken 6 months after the first treatment and showed significant
increases in collagen.
The investigators suggested that the dose be administered as a train of pulses,
that the skin should be cooled to 5°C, and that the fluence be controlled to
avoid the critical temperature which leads to cell destruction.

The investigators also suggested that patients be advised that the remodeling
progresses slowly over several months and that they should not be
disappointed by a lack of immediate effects.

CONCLUSION: _ Based on the information in this notification Quantel Medical concludes that
the Aramis II, when intended to be used for incision/excision, ablation, and
coagulation (homeostasis) of soft tissue for the removal of pigmented lesions;
photocoagulation of dermatological vascular lesions, including
photothermolysis of blood vessels (treatment of facial and leg veins) is
substantially equivalent to cited legally marketed predicates.

Quantel further concludes that the Aramis II intended the treatment of
periorbital and perioral wrinkles skin remodeling, is safe and effective for
these applications based on clinical studies and the ARAMIS II is
substantially equivalent to cited legally marketed products.

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
‘You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
‘devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
: adulteration.
