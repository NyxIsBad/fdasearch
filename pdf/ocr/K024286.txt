Common/Usual Name: Electrosurgical Instruments
Classification Name: Electrosurgical Cutting and Coagulation Device And Accessories
(21 CFR 878.4400)
Proprietary Name: Gyrus OPEN FORCEPS
The device is a Class II medical device. The Gyrus OPEN FORCEPS is a modification to the
predicate device cleared under K000496. The Open Forceps is similar in construction and in
component materials when compared to the predicate device. The indications for use are similar to
the predicate devices cleared under K981916 and K010010. The device consists of grasping jaws
connected to a handle. The handle has finger loops integrated into it to allow the physician to
easily manipulate the device for electrosurgical coagulation including the sealing of vessels. The
overall length of the device is nine (9) inches. The device will be available in three distinct jaw
configurations. The intended use of the device is to electrosurgically coagulate tissue and the
sealing of vessels up to 7mm during the performance of open general surgical procedures. The
energy source, Bipolar Electrosurgical Energy, is the same energy type as used for the predicate
devices. The forceps jaws are electrically isolated from each other enabling one jaw to act as a
return electrode, eliminating the need for a return pad. Preclinical laboratory data and bench test
data provide verification that the device is safe and effective and conforms to its Intended Use.
In conclusion, as the design, materials of construction, function and intended use of the Gyrus
OPEN FORCEPS is similar to that of the predicate devices currently cleared, Gyrus Medical Inc.
believes that no new issues of safety and effectiveness are raised and that the submitted device is
substantially equivalent.
