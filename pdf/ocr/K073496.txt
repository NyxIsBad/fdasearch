Device:
Trade Name: OptiLite™ Holmium Laser Fibers
Proposed Classification Name: Laser Instrument, Surgical, Powered
21 CFR Part 878.4810
Class Il, GEX
Predicate Devices:
The OptiLite™ Holmium Laser Fibers are similar with respect to indications for use and technology
to existing predicate devices in commercial distribution. Specifically, the OptiLite™Holmium Laser
Fibers are similar to the AccuFlex™ Holmium Laser Fibers (K994010) manufactured by
InnovaQuartz, Incorporated, distributed by Boston Scientific Corporation. The OptiLite™Holmium
Laser Fibers are identical to the OptiLITE™ IX Laser Surgery Accessories (K992866)
manufactured by Convergent Laser Technologies and distributed by Cook Urological, Incorporated.
Device Description:
The OptiLite™ Holmium Laser Fibers are intended to be used with legally cleared laser systems to
deliver laser energy. The fiber delivery system is typically used in conjunction with a rigid or
flexible endoscope to access the surgical site. The laser fibers work on the principle of total
internal reflection. Laser energy is focused into a glass silica fiber at the proximal end and
traverses the length of the fiber by means of total reflection. The fiber is able to contain the laser
beam and funnels the laser energy from the proximal end to the distal end.
Substantial Equivalence:
The Cook® Cervical Ripening Balloon is comparable with respect to intended use to the published
predicate device description and meets the requirements for 510(k) substantial equivalence.
Test Data:
Biocompatibility, sterility and performance testing were performed in accordance to Food and Drug
Administration guidance’s and recognized international standards. Testing data and information is
included in this submission.

Dear Ms. Foote:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set

forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Office of Compliance at
(240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled, "Misbranding by reference to
premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). For questions regarding postmarket surveillance,
please contact CDRH’s Office of Surveillance and Biometric’s (OSB’s) Division of Postmarket
Surveillance at (240) 276-3474. For questions regarding the reporting of device adverse events
(Medical Device Reporting (MDR)), please contact the Division of Surveillance Systems
at (240) 276-3464. You may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the
Act from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance
