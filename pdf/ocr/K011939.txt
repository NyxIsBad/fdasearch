Device Trade Name : Fotona Dualis KTP (532 nm) Laser System and
Accessories
Common Name : Frequency Doubled Nd:YAG Pulsed Surgical Laser
System /
Classification Name: Instrument, Surgical, Powered, Laser
79-GEX
21 CFR 878-4810
IL. Description
The Fotona Dualis KTP (532 nm) system is based on Nd:YAG laser technology. Within the system, an optical cavity contains the Nd:YAG crystal, which is activated by means of
the use of flashlamps. After the cavity, a red diode aiming beam is reflected onto a coaxial
beam path using a beamsplitter assembly. The combined therapuetic and aiming beams are
guided down an optical fiber delivery system to a focusing handpiece. The laser is used in
non-contact mode. /
The Dualis KTP system is designed with 3 major sub-systems:
a) An optical delivery system, interfacing the energy from the laser to the patient via an
3 optical fiber arm and a focusing handpiece.
b) An electronic power supply and interface circuitry.
c) An optical chamber containing laser rod and laser cavity optics.
I. Intended Use .

The Fotona Dualis KTP (532 nm) laser system is indicated for incision, ablation,
vaporization, coagulation, and hemostasis of vascular lesions and soft tissue in various
surgical areas. All soft tissue is included, such as skin, cutaneous tissue, subcutaneous
tissue, striated and smooth tissue, muscle, cartilage meniscus, mucous membrane, lymph
vessels and nodes, organs, and glands.

HI. Summary of Substantial Equivalence

oo Fotona believes that its Dualis KTP (532 nm) system is substantially equivalent to the
Coherent VersaPulse laser system, Laserscope Lyra laser system, and to other KTP (532
nm) lasers previously cleared for similar clinical applications.
All lasers are cleared for surgical incision, ablation, vaporization, coagulation, and
hemostasis of vascular lesions and soft tissue in various surgical areas. All soft tissue is
included, such as, skin, cutaneous tissue, subcutaneous tissue, striated and smooth tissue,
muscle, cartilage meniscus, mucous membrane, lymph vessels and nodes, organs, and
glands.
Technologically, the predicate devices have identical characteristics to the Dualis KTP
(532 nm) laser, all three comprising an electronic control module and a flashlamp pumped
Nd:YAG laser rod generating light at a wavelength of 532 jm, which is subsequently
delivered to the patient via an optical fiber and a focusing handpiece.

: The Dualis KTP (532 nm) laser output characteristics are very similar to those of the
predicate devices.
All lasers are microprocessor controlled devices.
All lasers utilize class I aiming beams which pose no hazard to the user.
All systems utilize an internal closed loop water-air heat exchanger circuit for optimal
thermal control of the laser cavity.
The risk and benefits for the Fotona Dualis KTP (532 nm) are comparable to the predicate
devices when used for similar clinical applications.
It is therefore believed that there are no new questions of Safety or Effectiveness raised by
the introduction of this device.

Dear Ms. Valjavec:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the
device referenced above and we have determined the device is substantially equivalent
(for the indications for use stated in the enclosure) to devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device
Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions
of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a
premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to
the general controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act
include requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing
practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III
(PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations
affecting your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts
800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your
device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does
not mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other
requirements of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other
Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not
limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good
manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation
(21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions
(Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 — Ms. Mojca Valjavec
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section
510(k) premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your
device to a legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device
and thus, permits your device to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801
and additionally 21 CFR Part 809.10 for in vitro diagnostic devices), please contact the
Office of Compliance at (301) 594-4659. Additionally, for questions on the promotion
and advertising of your device, please contact the Office of Compliance at (301) 5944639. Also, please note the regulation entitled, (Misbranding by reference to premarket
notification( (21CFR Part 807.97). Other general information on your responsibilities
under the Act may be obtained from the Division of Small Manufacturers, International
