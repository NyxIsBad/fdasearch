Predicate Device: Suction Coagulator
510(k) # KO33003
Device Description: This suction coagulator has applications in genera! surgical procedures to
provide a means of coagulation using electrosurgical current and also provide a means of suction
using the vent on the handle. Suction and coagulation can be performed independently or
simultaneously. The device consists of a cable for connection to the output of an electrosurgical
“generator unit, to carry high-frequency (HF) electrosurgical current to the distal end of the handpiece.
The handpiece acts as either a hand-switching or foot-switching conduit in delivering the HF energy
from the electrosurgical generator unit through the cannula tube to produce the therapeutic affect.
Current is activated by the coagulation switching element buttons on the handpiece or by using the
footswitch. The devices contain a non-stick (UltraClean™) coating on the cannula tip. The devices
will be distributed sterile and non-sterile for single-use applications.
Intended Use of Device: Single-use electrosurgical accessory used to provide coagulation
therapeutic energy to tissue and suction to aspirate blood, coagulum and small bits of tissue debris
from the surgical site. The coagulation effect is achieved by the passage of high frequency current
through the tissue of interest.
Technological Characteristics: The proposed device is equivalent to the identified predicate device
with respect to technological characteristics and function. The device has been designed to comply
with the applicable sections of ANSI/AAMI American National Standard for Electrosurgical Devices
HF-18, the international Electrotechnical Commission Standard for Electrosurgical Devices, IEC
60601-2-2, Sterilization of health care products — Requirements for validation and routine control ~
Radiation Sterilization, ISO 11137, Medical Devices Risk Management, ISO 14971 and
Biocompatibility, ISO 10993.

BIOCOMPATIBILITY: Page 2 4, @)

The materials and processes used in the construction of the CONMED UltraClean™
Suction Coagulator are identical to those of the predicate device with the addition of a silicone-coat
(Ultraclean™) on the cannula tip. The original materials have been tested in accordance with
accepted biocompatibility test methods and guidance such as ISO 10993 and the General Program
Memorandum #G95-1, dated May 1, 1995 and were found to be compatible with the human body.
The silicone coating added by ConMed Electrosurgery meets these same requirements and has
successfully completed the following biocompatibility testing: Cytotoxicity, Hemolysis, Pyrogen,
Intracutaneous Reactivity, Sensitization and Acute Systemic Injection testing (see attached
biocompatibility reports).

Table M.1 provides a list of materials used in the construction of the CONMED UltraClean™
Suction Coagulator and identifies the devices and applications where those materials are now in
use. Please note that this device is not indicated for prolonged direct contact with patient tissue. The
distance between the cannula and tissue undergoing coagulation is normally maintained at 1 cm or
less and only in temporary contact with tissue undergoing suction.

Dear Ms. Vetter:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class HI (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CER Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.

Page 2 — Ms. Vetter
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a legally
marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits your device
to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801), please
contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0115. Also, please note the regulation entitled,
"Misbranding by reference to premarket notification” (21CFR Part 807.97). You may obtain
