Intended Use Concerto™ Bipolar Needle Electrode is intended to be used in conjunction
and Device with a Boston Scientific radiofrequency (RF) generator for the thermal
Description coagulation necrosis of soft tissues, including partial or complete ablation of
nonresectable liver lesions. The Concerto™ Bipolar Needle Electrode is a
disposable, electrosurgical device used for coagulation necrosis of soft tissue.
The device consists of a needle with two electrically independent opposing
arrays that are contained within an insulated delivery cannula. The arrays are
attached to a handle mechanism that allows the arrays to be individually
deployed out from the cannula into the targeted tissue. The Concerto™
Bipolar Needle Electrode is connected to Boston Scientific radiofrequency
(RF) generator so that energy passes between the two arrays and heats the
tissue surrounding and in between the arrays. No grounding pads are
required due to the device's Bipolar technology.
Summary of The Concerto™ Bipolar Needle Electrode has been tested and compared to
Substantial the predicate device. All data gathered demonstrate this device as
Equivalence substantially equivalent. No new issues of safety or efficacy have been raised.

Dear Mr. Condakes:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class Il (Special Controls) or class I[] (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may
publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal Register.
Please be advised that FDA’s issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean
that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act
or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
