Description
General:
The Gyrus PlasmaCision and PlasmaBlend electrodes are bipolar electrosurgical
instruments with the capability to cut and coagulate soft tissue and blood vessels in
laparoscopic surgery under carbon dioxide gas or air insufflation. The instrument will
pass through a 5mm cannula or through an operating laparoscope working channel of
5mm or larger diameter. The PlasmaCision and PlasmaBlend electrodes may also be
used in general surgical procedures.
The instruments are to be used only with the Gyrus General Surgery RF Workstation.
Activation of the instruments is achieved via footswitch control.
Variants available:

The Instruments are available with and without aspiration (suction) / irrigation lines. On

such equipped instruments, this provides additional functionality to the device by

increasing its range of capabilities within the procedure. The suction / irrigation capable

versions incorporate a lumen / Y connector and male connector with polymeric tubing for

adaptation to suction / irrigation systems.

The instruments are, like other Gyrus bipolar electrosurgical instruments, available in a

number of different shaft lengths and diameters, chosen by the surgeon to be most

appropriate for the procedure to be undertaken.

Indication:

The instruments are indicated for Bipolar electrosurgical resection and coagulation of

soft tissue and blood vessels in laparoscopic or general surgical procedures.

Construction:

The instruments have a multipole arrangement at the patient interface. The instruments

consist of three individually isolated conductors that act as the tissue effectors.

E07 Generator Output to the L09 Instrument:

A PlasmaBlend output is a blended cut and coagulation output that is delivered to the

LO9 instrument. The ratio of cut to coagulation of this output is selectable by the user

and this allows the user to select the amount of haemostasis created during cutting. This

output is controlled by the Gyrus General Surgery RF Workstation.

Classification:

The instruments are Class II medical devices.

The system and therefore these instruments are intended for use by qualified medical

personnel trained in the use of electrosurgical equipment

Comparison to Predicate Devices:

The instruments are a development of a previously cleared electrosurgical instrument,

the PK Bipolar L Hook, cleared in 510(k) No. KO31082. The instruments has the same

intended use of Electrosurgical coagulation, cutting and dissection with aspiration

(suction) and irrigation. Its functionality is the same as the previously cleared Gyrus ENT

PlasmaCision Electrode, the OP!, cleared in 510(k) No. K041285 with suction

(aspiration).

The instruments has been carefully compared to the legally marketed devices with

respect to intended use and technological characteristics. In addition, performance

testing has been done to validate the performance of the device. The comparison and

validation results presented in this 510(k) notification to the FDA show that the device is

substantially equivalent to predicate devices and is safe and effective in its intended use.

Dear Mr. Jensen:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications
for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate
commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to
devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA).
You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general controls provisions of the Act. The
general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration, listing of
devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class I] (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it
may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can
be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may

or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must
comply with all the Act’s requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21
CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice requirements as set
forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if applicable, the electronic
product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act); 21 CFR 1000-1050.
